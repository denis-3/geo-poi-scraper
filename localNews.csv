District 2 Supervisor Catherine Stefani recused herself from representation because her husband owns a boat in the marina. The grassroots group “Keep The Waterfront Open” collected more than 2,500 signatures opposing plans that would remove boats located at Gashouse Cove — part of the Marina Small Craft Harbor since the 1960s — so that PG&E can “decontaminate the water.” Along with removal of the wooden slips and the only public fuel dock in town, the view of bobbing masts would be gone forever."",""Critics say the plan is really about the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department’s desire to accommodate much larger yachts, which would further restrict views from the Marina Green but would increase revenue flow to the agency, all while allowing PG&E to save millions by doing a less than adequate cleanup of its toxins under the water of the adjacent Gashouse Cove."",""With Stefani abstaining, the city charter says “the privilege of the floor shall not be granted, for any purpose, to persons other than officers of the City or their duly authorized representatives. This rule shall not be suspended except by unanimous consent of all Supervisors present,” which leaves residents without representation from their elected supervisor."",""At an Oct. 19 meeting, Rec and Park voted to move forward with an environmental impact review for the proposed plan, despite local opposition.""}",https://www.marinatimes.com/controversial-harbor-threatens-marina-green-view

Add to that the challenge of high rents; hiring; crime; and the pandemic, which forced the closure of many businesses, owning or opening a small business in the city is challenging. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20 percent of new businesses fail, and some reports are that it is higher in San Francisco."",""There may be hope: Earlier this year, Mayor London Breed proposed legislation to improve the permitting process with more than 100 changes to the current Planning Code. Among the proposed changes are allowing more business uses on ground floors to help fill commercial vacancies; lifting restrictions on restaurants and bars in certain neighborhoods — including Union Street; easing the legalization process for existing outdoor patios; and enabling nighttime entertainment, bars, and restaurants to benefit from priority permit processing."",""The legislation is in part designed to provide small businesses the ability to adapt to a “flexible retail” model, which currently is allowed only in certain districts, and would accommodate changing circumstances, such as the pandemic and consumer behavior. That model would allow previously existing business to change to a different use without having to reapply to the city for new permits for each change."",""The Planning Commission will consider these changes in a public meeting on Sept 7.""}",https://www.marinatimes.com/jump-starting-businesses-in-our-neighborhoods

Installations are expected to start in the summer."",""Six speed cameras are proposed for Ingleside and nearby neighborhoods: Ocean Avenue from Friday Kahlo Way to Howth Street, San Jose Avenue from Santa Ynez Avenue to Ocean Avenue, Alemany Boulevard from Farragut Avenue to Naglee Avenue, Mission Street from Ottawa Avenue to Allison Street, Geneva Avenue from Prague Street to Brookdale Avenue and Monterey Boulevard from Edna Street to Congo Street."",""“I think the ones that we ended up recommending are the ones that are definitely the strongest because I think this is an opportunity for us to change policy not only in San Francisco but in California,” Hake said."",""Pedestrian and road safety is on NMTIA members’ minds following recent pedestrian fatalities by motor vehicles at the Alemany Boulevard and Rousseau Street intersection in February and the March 16 crash that killed three people beside West Portal Station on Saturday."",""NMTIA recently welcomed a new traffic light at Alemany Boulevard and Theresa Street with other neighbors and District 11 Supervisor Ahsha Safaí on Feb. 24."",""“That’s why the speed cameras, more than anything, are so important to pedestrian and people’s lives because every five to ten miles [per hour] you go up, the probability of death goes up dramatically,” Safaí said."",""Several attendees asked about the cost of this project and how it would work for those caught speeding. Hake said it would be funded through the transportation agency’s operating budget to get a camera vendor and any revenue that is earned will initially go toward covering program costs with any additional income going towards traffic calming improvements."",""Offenders would be charged a penalty at a cost of $50 to $500 depending on how many mph over the speed limit they drive. Violations would also be issued as civil penalties and treated more like tollbooth charges with the ticket going to the individual on the vehicle's registration."",""Sam Thomas, who lives on San Jose Avenue, said a speed camera on Alemany Boulevard is “super important.”"",""“Alemany is super dangerous,” Thomas said. “We just had a neighbor who died on Cotter.

Dorsey was the main sponsor of the resolution."",""“With the San Francisco Board of Supervisors’ passage of this resolution today, we’re expanding on our city’s commitment to its diverse communities by supporting the diverse community-based journalism that’s part of it,” Dorsey added."",""The report titled “Local Voices on Local News: Community Perspectives and Policy Recommendations for Strengthening San Francisco’s Journalism Ecosystem” released in February looked at the community and ethnic journalism community landscape and held focus groups in different languages (English, Chinese Spanish and Tagalog) for several months with San Franciso residents to find what their needs are in reading local news."",""“Local news is critical to our democracy, and we know that San Franciscans are hungry for more,” said Maya Chupkov, media and democracy program manager at California Common Cause in a news release."",""One of the recommendations in the report was the idea of city departments shifting some of the advertising money they spend to independent media publishers that would help provide resources for community and ethnic media news outlets to stay afloat."",""The report said community journalism news media outlets play a critical role in the media landscape as they report and cover news stories in the community and neighborhoods that are not necessarily the main focus of major news outlets in San Francisco."",""“This investment in local media has proven successful in New York and Chicago, and will likewise ensure that our city government supports and communicates directly and effectively with readers of underserved ethnic and community media,” said Michael Yamashita in a news release, who is the publisher of the Bay Area Reporter newspaper."",""At the request of Dorsey, the Budget and Legislative Analyst released a report last December to provide options for creating a program to direct more advertising spending to these types of outlets. The BLA report said 98 media outlets were operating in the city, but only seven publications were approved by the Board of Supervisors for an advertising contract to publish legally required notices for fiscal year 2023-24."",""The BLA report looked at other cities that have programs where advertising and outreach expenditures go to community news outlets. Cities, namely New York, have codified into law that at least 50% of all print and digital advertising — excluding legally required notices — be spent in community and ethnic media outlets. A list of media outlets was compiled and an office within the mayor’s office was created to monitor the program."",""The BLA gave city officials policy considerations if they were to pursue such a program like New York, including a vetted directory of community and ethnic news outlets and setting a mandated percentage of advertising that would go towards these news outlets. Additionally, the BLA stated the city would need to clearly define what is considered advertising, establish a system to track how spending will be tracked and reported and determine which community and ethnic media outlets can qualify as a city vendor."",""San Francisco State University Journalism Department Chair Jesse Garnier said there should also be other criteria established to prevent political interference if community and ethnic journalism outlets were to receive money from the city government. The journalism department is acting as a local independent monitor to help with the city’s plan to prioritize advertising dollars to ethnic media outlets and independent news publishers."",""The Bay Area Independent Community Media Coalition, which is being led by California Common Cause and includes several community and bilingual publications in print and online in the city, is advocating for a policy solution that would increase the amount of advertising the city spends in local community and ethnic media outlets. The Ingleside Light is a participant, and — despite publishing bonafide journalism for an eager hyperlocal every week — it cannot participate in the city’s outreach advertising because the rules have not been modernized for the digital age."",""“We are energized to work with the city, ethnic and multilingual media outlets, and local community publishers to carry out recommendations from the report.

In particular, he proposed to remove all large homeless encampments in six months, wean downtown San Francisco off of its dependence on the tech industry, increase police staffing levels and open 24/7 clinics for drug users. "",""But, like others, he contrasted the San Francisco of today with earlier, better times. In the old days, if you told someone you were from San Francisco, said the 50-year-old San Francisco native, “It was met with a sense of awe, a sense of wonderment, even envy. And today you get, ‘Are you okay?’”"",""As he sees it, San Francisco’s public safety, street conditions and economy have never been worse. And that’s mostly due to a “plain and simply failed leadership,” said Farrell. San Francisco used to have more than 2,300 police officers when Ed Lee was the mayor and Farrell was a supervisor, he said. The same number now stands at 1,857, according to the police department. Farrell mentioned former District Attorney Chesa Boudin for demoralizing the police department. "",""“Since I left office, our population has declined,”  he said. “So inherently, crime should decline because of that on its face.”"",""The crime rate, however, did decline. San Francisco saw fewer cases of both property crimes and violent crimes in 2023 than 2018, the year Farrell left office. "",""“We need to have law enforcement in San Francisco, just on principle, to create a civil society, to make sure there is deterrent,” he said. “In San Francisco, at times in the past, that has been foreign. But I think it’s just common sense that needs to be brought back.”"",""Farrell argued that his 7.5 years at City Hall — seven years as District 2 supervisor and six months as mayor after Ed Lee died — had equipped him with “a consistent track record” that voters could predict his performance in office. "",""To him, Mayor London Breed’s track record has been inconsistent on a number of issues. Regarding the abandoned downtown, he said Breed’s ideas make the city look disorganized: “What we heard was week one, we’re going to build science labs. Week two, we’re going to build housing. Week three, it was a U.C. campus, and then it became a soccer stadium.” "",""Michael Petrelis, who is running for District 9 supervisor, disrupted the conversation early on from outside the cafe, holding a sign that read “Ban cars now!” and interjecting frequently. He blared criticisms of Farrell from a bullhorn, but the volume on the speakers’ microphones was turned up, and Petrelis left after some 20 minutes. (We reported earlier that Petrelis attempted to shut down the event and left because he was tired. Petrelis wrote in an email, “My goal was not to stop the conversation and my cameraman had to leave because he had a date. I didn’t leave because I was tired.”"",""Macy’s recent closure announcement “caught the mayor’s office off guard, and City Hall off guard,” said Farrell, who noted similar situations also happened with Nordstrom and the San Francisco Centre’s closure. "",""Farrell said Breed’s office does not have relationships with the city’s largest tenants, largest building owners and the equity and debt behind them. This situation wouldn’t have happened if he were mayor, he said. He wouldn’t have been blindsided, and would’ve brought everyone together and worked out a solution comprehensively, he said. "",""As for plans for a downtown recovery, Farrell said he would first focus on addressing public safety and street conditions, to create an environment where employers and employees would be willing to come back."",""“Diversification” was his diagnosis for downtown in the long term. “You know, we were over-reliant on the tech industry,” said Farrell. "",""“To the point where everyone wore the same vest,” noted Eskenazi."",""“I’m glad I didn’t wear mine tonight,” said Farrell, who sported a black suit and white button-down. He noted that the tech industry’s tendency to work from home has turned San Francisco’s downtown into a veritable ghost town. "",""How would the public sector fix things that it neither created nor broke? Eskenazi asked."",""The power of tax incentives, Farrell answered. In 2011, Mayor Lee and the Board of Supervisors, including Farrell, managed to use tax breaks to attract Twitter to revitalize mid-Market. “But it didn’t work. We learned our lessons as well,” he said. "",""Twitter brought a Silicon Valley model campus to San Francisco, having an in-house gym, an in-house cafe and even in-house dry cleaning, which prevented the surrounding neighborhoods from benefiting much, he said. “If we do this again, we have to do it in a much different, much smarter way,” he said. "",""“I think unless we’re aggressive about [reviving downtown], we’re going to lose downtown forever in a potential way,” he said. "",""Farrell also wants cars back on Market Street. “Let’s just have common sense again,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to admit that taking cars off Market Street, it’s not a panacea.”"",""“Market Street hasn’t been safer, statistically, since we took cars off Market Street,” Farrell said. "",""Contrasting Farrell’s citation of statistics regarding street safety — but not crime, in which people “feel” less safe in spite of statistically lower levels, Eskenazi quipped “But I feel safer.” "",""As for this week’s tragic car collision at West Portal which killed a family of four, Farrell said the lesson he drew was that the city should be “very granular” about every single intersection. He said he learned from friends who live in West Portal that, prior to the accident, the local community had sent multiple emails to the city saying it was a dangerous intersection, emails that went unheeded."",""When asked who he would fire as mayor, Farrell mentioned the head of SFMTA, Jeffrey Tumlin, to promote public transportation, bicycling and pedestrian safety. In particular, he mentioned SFMTA’s L Taraval Project. “You tore up the street. You took away every single parking spot in the name of increasing the time or decreasing the time it will take for a trolley to get down the road and down. But you know what you’re also doing? Killing. You’re killing a lot of small businesses,” he said. "",""And Police Chief Bill Scott, whom Farrell called “a very good man” who had simply been in the position too long. “At the end of the day, the average tenure of a police chief in the U.S. is three years, and he has been here for almost eight,” Farrell said. "",""Farrell also intends to back city charter reform on November’s ballot, to guarantee the mayor always has the power to fire or hire department heads in a “plain and simple” way. This week, Farrell created a political action committee to push two ballot measures that would do just that, while also allowing the mayoral candidate to seek unlimited campaign donations to ostensibly back those ballot measures."",""Asked whether he would support Breed’s recent veto of Board President Aaron Peskin’s legislation limiting density in areas of his district, Farrell said he would."",""“I need you to speak loudly so the people in District 2 can hear you,” Eskenazi said. Would they want 270-foot high-rises in their neighborhoods? "",""It’s not about housing, but about “sloppy legislation” inside City Hall, said Farrell. “We had last summer’s density increases that everyone agreed upon. We come a few months later and say, ‘Whoops, I didn’t mean that we’re going to density decrease.’”"",""Farrell sought to sidestep a pro-housing or anti-housing characterization, falling back on his “common sense” pitch."",""“Where is this common sense, once again?” said Farrell. “This gets back to the YIMBY, NIMBY, different sides of the aisle, where it’s just a zero-sum game and somebody has to win. Unless you’re fully with us, you’re off the boat.”"",""“I do not believe that we need to upzone every single neighborhood in San Francisco,” he added, saying it is the wrong approach. “As is the approach to say that we’re not going to build anywhere in San Francisco. We can do it in a very smart manner.”"",""Farrell also promised to take out all the large homeless encampments in six months by offering residents shelter, which he did as mayor in 2018, he said. "",""He suggested having clinics for substance use care open 24/7. “We have to capture [drug users] when they’re willing to make a different decision. And to give them a chance for a better life,” he said."",""And, on Day One, he would audit all of the San Francisco nonprofits working on homelessness, because the city is funding a large amount of overlapping services, he said. There could be as many as nine city departments that fund homeless spending, he said. “Many fund the same nonprofit, but don’t realize that they’re doing it, and have different metrics for how they’re measuring success.”"",""Asked which past mayor he would seek to emulate, Farrell pointed to traits of several different city leaders. Farrell appreciated former Mayor Willie Brown’s ability to simply get things done, he said, and Gavin Newsom’s bold approach to politics and policy. He aspired to Ed Lee’s patience and Dianne Feinstein’s genuine love of San Francisco. "",""He chose not to answer who his ranked-choice alliance would be, saying it was premature, but acknowledged that it would be a part of any mayoral candidate’s strategy. "",""If elected, Farrell, who was the longest-serving Board of Supervisors budget chair in San Francisco’s history, will also be one of the first — if not the first — mayors of a major American city who is a venture capitalist.

ASCARRUNZ,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:40 AM","Review: Foliage, Precita Park spot offering prix fixe menu, can do better",,"{""Foliage opened in October 2023 in the space vacated by Michelin-starred Marlena, which has since moved to Japantown as the already acclaimed Adams 7 — Japantown’s gain, our loss. "",""Foliage owners Stephane Roulland and Julia Indovina brought in Chef Mo Béjar to the beautiful corner space by Precita Park. When my editor asked me to review the new restaurant at their publicist’s request, I was salivating at the prospect of trying another somewhat affordable ($75) prix-fixe menu in the area. Béjar hails from the Central Valley, and his dishes have the requisite farm-to-table, sustainable and beautiful aesthetic, and they sounded interesting and fresh, with a few culinary twists and turns. "",""We started out with the house-made milk bread with cultured butter. The other option was the bread with a spiced salt and Spanish jamón, but we went for the basic. "",""This gorgeous golden orb came to the table, warm and inviting, with a very generous slab of butter, gleaming with crystals of crunchy salt. Plenty for us to have two wedges apiece, the interior was fluffy and yeasty, and gave us high hopes for the rest of the meal. Besides, who ever gives you enough butter with your bread? "",""The prix-fixe menu at Foliage offers two options per course, plus some optional add-ons. We decided to get each of the options, so that we would get to taste everything."",""First course: Amberjack crudo with lacto-fermented pineapple, banana, macadamia nuts, and thinly sliced kohlrabi. "",""The vegetarian option: Avocado with essentially the same ingredients."",""Both had a little funk, with an inexplicable paprika oil at the bottom of the bowls. The amberjack was lovely, but it was an odd combination of flavors; banana and fish connote a somewhat Caribbean vibe, but it didn’t really work for us. We were also a bit puzzled about the choice to take the same ingredients and simply substitute avocado for the protein. It seemed to me that here was a perfect, missed opportunity to make a wholly different, inventive vegetarian option. While we weren’t thrilled with the amberjack dish, the vegetarian option was lackluster. "",""Second course: Shrimp toast and ricotta gnocchi."",""Beautiful dishes, both. The Foliage shrimp toast was wonderful; super crispy, light, highly spiced, with a Sichuan peppercorn aioli, and perfectly cooked shrimp. I’d get it again (and, in fact, I did). Our only quibble was the Osetra caviar was wasted on this. You literally could not taste it with everything else going on."",""The gnocchi dish came with a lovely gorgonzola sauce, pooled under beautifully wilted and browned sweet cabbage, topped with fried sage and toasted nuts. Unfortunately, the cabbage was the best thing on the plate; the ricotta gnocchi themselves were severely tough and dense. We found them inedible, and when the runner eventually came around to ask if he could take the plate (without asking why the dish was untouched), I told him that the gnocchi were very hard. He apologized profusely and said he would tell the chef. When he returned, he informed us the chef admitted that they were usually softer, and asked if we wanted him to try making them again, or did we want another shrimp toast? Perhaps we should have taken him up on the offer for a re-do, but we took the safe-bet toast. My question is: How does that go out to a table? And were others eating those heavy gnocchi without complaint?"",""At that point, the courses seemed to have slowed down. I’d finished a glass of Cremant bubbly, and asked the runner for the list so I could order a glass of wine. He misheard me, and brought another glass of the same sparkling wine. He apologized, and began to take it back, but my sister said she would just take it so it wouldn’t go to waste. She hadn’t planned on having alcohol with dinner. I ordered a very good cabernet."",""Next came our entrée courses. The options were local cod over sweet potato puree with fava greens and charred leeks, or roasted cauliflower with a vadouvan crema for the vegetarian dish. Or, for an additional $15, a coulotte steak (described by our server as “the best cut, the top of the sirloin.”) with mole, chayote, citrus, and chocolate jus. Sold! We ordered the fish and the steak."",""The cod was a bit on the small side, slightly overdone, the skin could have been a little crisper for my taste, but overall had good flavor. The underlying sweet potato puree and leeks were good, the garum (an ancient Roman fish sauce) very subtle. I was busy eating my portion of the fish before switching off with my sister, so I didn’t notice she was having trouble with the steak."",""When they first put the dish on the table, I asked if the thin brown sauce underneath the steak was the mole, and our runner said no, that’s the chocolate jus. A minute later, the chef himself came by with an extra little ramekin of the orange mole, which had been hiding under the chayote. A nice gesture, though I hadn’t asked for more; I just hadn’t seen it on the plate. We chatted with Chef Béjar a few minutes, asked where he’d cooked before, wished him well. "",""The steak was rare (which we both like), and I finally noticed my sister sawing away at the meat for an interminable amount of time. She looked at me in disbelief. “You need to cut this into really small pieces, or you won’t be able to chew it.” I tried my hand at it and, sure enough, it took at least 10 seconds to hack free a tiny piece, and then another 10 to chew it until it was soft enough to swallow. Again, we just could not eat it. The Foliage mole itself was — sorry, the only word I can think of is strange — citrusy, and unlike any other mole I’d ever had. The chayote was hard and flavorless. Our server finally came by and asked us how we were enjoying the course as she stared at the full plate. I demonstrated how hard it was to cut through the meat. She replied, “Yes, because it’s a very chewy cut.” Before I could show my amazement at this explanation, she quickly asked if she should take it away and I said “yes, please.”"",""In all the time I’ve been reviewing for Mission Local, I really can’t remember sending a dish back, much less two in one meal. By this point, we were looking around at the quite full restaurant and wondering if it was just us? We’re normally not that picky (in fact, I often get accused of liking everything indiscriminately), and we don’t relish making a scene. It was baffling, as no one else seemed to be having an issue, but seemed to be enjoying their meals thoroughly. "",""Dessert course: One was a mango semifreddo with tuile crumbles, a little mango jelly, and mint. "",""“Semifreddo” means “partially frozen.” The ice cream here, unfortunately, was a solid disk, and we had to wait a bit for it to soften. It tasted fine, however; very subtly mango flavored. "",""The other dessert was a white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries. The panna cotta was nicely creamy and, thankfully, not too sweet. All in all, there was nothing wrong with the desserts; they were simply unremarkable."",""And the perfect ending to our meal? As I reached for the bill, my hand hit my glass which still had some wine in it — only my second glass of the evening, mind you — and in dramatic fashion knocked it onto the table, smashing it loudly, flinging wine and bits of glass everywhere. A shard actually drew blood from my sister’s hand. Mortified, I now saw myself through the eyes of our servers and chef: “Oh, was that the drunk woman who complained about everything?” I apologized over and over, all were gracious, mopping up the mess and making light of the incident. The Foliage staff handled it with class and kindness."",""They also graciously took the $15 steak off our bill without my asking, charged us for the wine that was a mistake (which, yes, we’d drank), and handed us a bill for close to $250. "",""It truly pains me to write a review like this. Anyone can make a mistake; a bad dish can happen to any kitchen, but don’t send it out. If a cut of beef is so chewy, cook it some other way. The deficiencies in the dishes we disliked were basic errors in execution. I know it is an excruciatingly difficult thing to open, run, and maintain a restaurant for any length of time, in this city, or anywhere. What a feather in Chef Béjar’s cap to have opened in this lovely space, with a ready-made clientele mourning the loss of their beloved Marlena. (NB: I never told anyone at the restaurant that I was reviewing that night, even though we’d been asked to do so.)"",""I’m hoping this was simply an anomaly, as I’m rooting for Chef Béjar to achieve success in that space, and for Foliage to become a neighborhood mainstay, as I’m sure the Precita Park community is hoping as well. "",""Foliage SF (website)

Days after advocates participated in their second school district meeting on March 13, the district let them know that both positions would come back, according to Maia Piccagli, president of the school’s Parent Action Council."",""She wasn’t quite sure exactly why, but thought it had something to do with their advocacy. “I felt amazing, I felt really excited. Honestly, I’ve done a lot of advocacy in my life, but I have rarely seen an immediate change,” she said. “It felt great to have had so many parents involved in making statements and having there be such a quick win afterwards.”"",""“We are happy to hear that SFUSD leadership is receiving and applying feedback,” said Frank Lara, executive vice president of United Educators of San Francisco, in a statement."",""The school district, while emphasizing it is “committed to a transparent process for school staffing and budget allocation,” did not specify how the decision had been made."",""SoMa’s Bessie Carmichael School PreK-8 Filipino Education Center also got what its parents and teachers advocated for: The reinstatement of one of the school’s two social workers, who the school district was going to cut. The good news came last Thursday morning — less than two days after the school board meeting, according to the school community. "",""Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School’s parents and teachers advocated for seven teaching positions the district had put on the block.  "",""The community learned early last week that the school district would reinstate two of their campus security positions, according to principal Claudia Delarios-Moran, who remains uncertain of the reason. These are necessary positions for the school, parents and teachers said, which the school had planned to hire at its own expense in the coming school year."",""While the school district declined to add back the seven teaching positions, the money Buena Vista Horace Man will be able to save from spending on two campus security positions will be used to hire an extra teacher, reducing the casualties from seven to six. The school plans to hire a teacher to help with its fourth and fifth grades with the $157,000 saved, according to Delarios-Moran."",""“I feel relieved, because it allows us to cut one less position,” said Delarios-Moran. “It gets us closer to where we were before in the first place.”"",""Twin Peaks’ Rooftop School TK-8 was not as fortunate. The school district informed the school in early March that it would lose one of its kindergarten positions. The school community made comments at the March 4 district advisory meeting, but didn’t show up at the following week’s school board meeting."",""The position was not reinstated."",""“They did not give us our kindergarten class back,” Rooftop Principal Darren Kawaii said last Friday.

Ferrall also determined that the case will move forward to trial in early April."",""Reyes, a worker with the nonprofit Mission Graduates’ after-school program, was arrested on March 5 at Everett Middle School following alleged improper contact with a student. He has been in custody since the arrest. "",""On March 11, Reyes pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment. His maximum time in prison would be 14 years for the charges, which include three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, unlawful sexual intercourse and contact with a minor for sexual offense, according to court documents. "",""A preliminary hearing was held today in Department 13 on the second floor of the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. Only Reyes’ mother and two other family members were in the courtroom’s audience. "",""Reyes showed up in an orange jumpsuit and smiled when saw his family members. Throughout the two-hour hearing, Reyes repeatedly looked back to exchange glances with his family, especially his mother. At one point, Reyes mouthed “Love you” to his mother, who nodded in response. "",""Deputy public defender Semuteh Freeman, who represents Reyes, said her client was comfortable participating in the hearing in English until a Spanish interpreter was available, saying that Reyes attended school and was educated in English from the age of 13. Two interpreters arrived in the second hour of the hearing and began interpreting the proceedings for Reyes."",""Prosecutor Tanisha Gooch summoned two witnesses today: A San Francisco police officer and a sergeant, who both had first-hand information regarding the case. "",""Officer Bryan Santan responded with his partner to the initial call at 12:45 p.m. on March 5 . He spoke with both Principal Alicia Blacknell and the alleged victim in the principal’s office at Everett Middle School. "",""Santana said the victim and Reyes had known each other for several months before the alleged rape. They had kissed several times prior to March 5, but had not had a prior sexual relationship. While Santana continued to describe details of the alleged rape, Reyes shook his head. "",""The purported victim took the bus to 16th and Mission streets, and then walked to meet Reyes at his nearby apartment, where the alleged rape took place, according to what Santana learned. The victim went to school after leaving Reyes’ apartment. Later, she felt physical pain and messaged Reyes. "",""While being interviewed by Officer Santana on March 5, Blacknell identified Reyes as the “boyfriend” the victim had mentioned to her. Santana also identified Reyes in the courtroom today."",""On March 5, the alleged victim told Santana, a certified Spanish translator, that her communication with Reyes was in Spanish. Santana saw several screenshots of the victim’s text messages, in Spanish, with Reyes. He told the court that the principal showed him the screenshots, and he saw them again later after obtaining the alleged victim’s phone. "",""Both public defender Freeman and officer Santana agreed today that the resolution of the screenshots presented as exhibits in court today was so low that they were not legible. Still, Santana described what he could remember of the text messages."",""He saw messages, including heart-shaped emojis, in Instagram DMs. He also recalled seeing the background photo of the alleged victim and Reyes’ WhatsApp exchange, which he said both sides could see: “The photo behind the entire series of texts that I was shown appeared to be the victim in a bra, wearing a small pair of jean shorts, looking away from the camera,” Santana said."",""He also recalled the 12-year-old and Reyes calling each other pet names, saying “I love you,” and sending emojis of heart shapes and kisses. Once, Reyes even sent a Spanish sentence that could be roughly translated as “I wanna eat you up,” according to Santana."",""But not every communique between the alleged victim and Reyes was so light. When the 12-year-old informed Reyes of being in pain after sexual intercourse, court documents list his responses as, “I’m sorry for being so hard” and “It only hurts the first time.” "",""Santana acknowledged that neither he nor his partner turned their body camera on when they interviewed the 12-year-old on March 5, because of the police department’s policy on such cameras."",""The second witness, Sergeant Daniel Kelly, was assigned the case on March 5, and spoke to the alleged victim about Reyes that evening. According to Kelly, she first met Reyes in late 2023, months before Reyes started working in the after-school program at Everett. When the alleged rape occurred on March 5, the victim was aware that Reyes was working at Everett, and that day was her first visit to Reyes’ apartment."",""Kelly said the 12-year-old named three platforms on which she and Reyes had been communicating: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The girl’s phone has been turned over to the Crime Scene Investigation’s multimedia evidence unit."",""Kelly also interviewed Reyes at Mission Station on March 5 and described Reyes as “calm.” Reyes said he taught art and coached sixth, seventh and eighth grade soccer at Everett. Reyes, who has a young child of his own, said he believed the victim was approximately 16 years old. He also said they were in love with each other; “that nobody has ever made him feel the way Jane Doe has,” said Kelly.  "",""He said “other female students [at Everett] had been essentially throwing themselves at him in a romantic sense, trying to give him hugs, trying to locate him on social media, messaging him [so much] that he had to regularly rebuff them,” said Kelly, recounting a conversation with Reyes."",""Reyes acknowledged that he knew the victim was too young to have a sexual relationship with him, Kelly testified."",""Kelly has had difficulty locating the address of the apartment where the alleged rape took place. According to the sergeant, Reyes provided one address, while Kelly and his team found another. "",""The victim received medical care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. "",""Reyes has been held in jail without bail. “The Defendant is an employee at a middle school, and thus surrounded by potential future victims,” the District Attorney’s Office argued in court documents. "",""Attorneys of both parties and Judge Ferrall discussed whether Reyes should be moved to home detention, which Ferrall later dismissed, citing a public-safety risk."",""Public defender Freeman said that, while Reyes did have a prior misdemeanor conviction in Richmond when he was 18, he has no other criminal record. Freeman said he has been shuttled in and out of foster care facilities since he was 13. Once Reyes was incarcerated, he lost the funds to pay rent for his apartment."",""“I’m asking the court to consider the effect of prolonged incarceration on him. I do think that there are other non-carceral ways that the court can ensure public safety,” said Freeman. “I don’t think he’s a flight risk, both because we have a default here, but also because he has a child and mother, and he is co-parenting his child.”"",""Freeman also noted that the Central American Resource Center of Northern California has been working with Reyes and his mother on asylum claims."",""“The people are concerned about public safety,” prosecutor Gooch argued. “He’s making comments that the young girls at this middle school who are in grades six through eight, are throwing themselves at him. He acknowledged during his interview that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that the victim was too young, but he did it anyway, because that’s how love works.”"",""“I agree he’s not a flight risk, but the risk to public safety, from the evidence I’ve heard, is severe,” said Ferrall, who said the material presented today in court was “extremely troubling.” "",""“I can’t say that I’m comfortable with a less restrictive alternative of home detention, given what’s happened, and none of which would have been prevented by him being on electronic monitoring in his apartment,” he added, adding that the fact that the alleged rape happened at Reyes’ home rendered home detention a risk."",""The judge also mentioned that Reyes has inflicted a potentially lifetime impact on the alleged victim. He also found Reyes’ comments of other girls at Everett throwing themselves at him troubling."",""Ferrall discharged the felony charge of sodomy of a person under 18 for lack of evidence. Five felony charges remain."",""After the decisions were made, Reyes broke into tears, lowering his head while his shoulders shook uncontrollably. Reyes’ mother, whose eyes were red from a morning of crying, called out words of encouragement to Reyes in Spanish. "",""Ferrall also determined that he had seen enough evidence for Reyes to be held to answer, and the case will move forward to trial in early April."",""The court has prohibited Reyes from coming within 150 yards of the victim or having electronic, written or telephonic contact with the victim, or contacting the victim through a third party other than the attorney.  ""}",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/everett-after-school-worker-accused-of-rape-remains-incarcerated-troubling-material-emerges-in-court/

And multifaceted. This is a multi-front war. It will be fought over the now moderate-heavy Democratic County Central Committee, the big-money groups spending with sailor-on-liberty ferocity over the last several election cycles, neighborhood and ethnic Democratic clubs, and influential and quasi-influential individuals. When it comes to bending the ears of individual DCCC member-elects, we’re told, “the wooing season has already started.” "",""Mayor London Breed’s team has, additionally, made it clear that it is not interested in any dual or ranked endorsements. This is a loaded decree coming from a sitting mayor who’ll be running this town for the next eight-odd months (and may yet win in November). It’d be nice if she picked up the phone for you, right? Political and governmental issues aren’t supposed to bleed into one another, but it often happens here on planet Earth.  "",""At this point, this is just a battle over endorsements. Breed’s demand that she and she alone be recognized makes political sense. It does not benefit her to have other people’s names and photos on the campaign brochures she’d rather have featuring her and her alone. That’s hardly unwise or crazy. "",""But there’s a difference between consolidating endorsements for a campaign and actually running a campaign. And, at this point, everything seems to point toward the mayor having little interest in engaging with the ranked-choice strategy that has governed San Francisco elections for a generation and will decide this one, whether she likes it or not. "",""Do you know what percentage of the time the candidate who wins the most first-place votes goes on to win in a ranked-choice election? According to the data sets over at Fair Vote, it’s around 94 percent. Didn’t Mayor Breed finish first in a 2018 election in which she put minimal effort into a ranked-choice strategy, and then hang on to beat Mark Leno and Jane Kim, who put a maximal effort into such a strategy? Yes, that happened. So what’s the big deal? "",""Let’s address the higher-end issue first. Many elections, if not most, are not particularly competitive. If we had a ranked-choice contest on what to have for dinner and the choices were pizza, haggis or Scandinavian aspic, the permutations of RCV would not likely come into play. "",""And that leads to the forthcoming San Francisco mayoral election — and how, in some ways, it’s 180 degrees different than the race Breed won in 2018. One thing it certainly isn’t is a pizza-haggis-aspic competition. It seems plain that this one is going to be competitive, and the notion of any of the declared candidates amassing a double-digit first-round lead, as Breed did in 2018, feels more than a bit fanciful. It certainly doesn’t feel like a solid assumption that our deeply unpopular incumbent mayor, who is running in the same ideological lane as two other well-financed competitors, is a lock to finish first at all. "",""In that 2018 contest, Leno and Kim each garnered about 60,000 first-place votes. That was a good 30,000 behind Breed — but, combined, the two outpolled her handily. Over the course of eight rounds of ranked-choice tabulations, Leno gained on Breed, eventually losing by just 2,500-odd votes, a 50.55 to 49.45 tilt. "",""In 2024, we won’t have two candidates neatly splitting the pie among voters less ideologically inclined to vote for Breed. Rather, now we’ll have multiple candidates on her side of the sandbox, splitting her voters. There is, clearly, a big center-left lane in which to run. Aaron Peskin is biding his time like Godot — And if he doesn’t come? We’ll come back tomorrow. And then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. But it figures he will eventually arrive. Perhaps as soon as April. "",""Peskin is in no hurry. Why interrupt this moderate-on-moderate violence? But when he does finally enter, a ranked-choice strategy among his mayoral competitors would seem to be de rigueur. But it remains to be seen if these candidates can get over individual ambitions and personal animosity to agree on anything. Election professionals worry that these sorts of deals, at least early in the election cycle, project weakness. They also give your chosen voter base tacit permission to vote for another candidate. "",""Election professionals, however, also know the value of (eventually) forming alliances. Candidates, though, often don’t; candidates can be the most inconvenient part of the electoral process for election professionals. So can voters, who are less ideological than political insiders and, messaging be damned, vote for candidate combinations that don’t make intuitive sense. One casualty of moderate-on-moderate violence may be punch-drunk voters. "",""“There should be genuine concern about confusing voters,” a moderate operative tells me. "",""Ranked-choice voting needn’t be confusing, but politics often is. In 2018, even up to the penultimate seventh round of ranked-choice tabulations, Kim and Leno held nearly 57 percent of the vote. The electorate, at that time, was clearly leaning progressive, so multiple progressives entered the fray, split the vote, diluted their collective leverage, and the mayoral contest was won by a moderate. It’s funny how that works. "",""This year, the electorate would seem to be leaning moderate. And, lo, multiple moderates have entered the fray. Moderates have the clear advantage — and, as a result of that, every individual candidate is incentivized to stay in the race, work for his or her own benefit, and dilute their collective leverage.

Meet Chester Moody."",""It’s 1958 in the Jim Crow South: Lorman, Mississippi, to be precise. He is 17 years old, attending Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college, and he is in excruciating pain.  At the administration office, he is told it will be 21 days before a dentist visits the college, and Black students can’t leave campus."",""So, young Chester Moody broke into the campus woodshop, borrowed a pair of pliers, and performed his own extraction."",""“It took me a while to get the courage, but the moment I clamped the pliers around that molar, the pain went away,” recalls Moody, 84, from his dental lab on the 16th floor of the downtown Sutter Street Medical/Dental Building, where he fabricates dental prosthetics, including dentures, implants and more. “I now know that it was the gas escaping, but I couldn’t walk around with pliers coming out of my mouth. I was screwing up my courage to pull, and suddenly there was a snap and the top part of the tooth was gone! Oh, the smell was terrible, but the relief was instant.”"",""Born in 1939 in Coffeeville, Mississippi,  Moody studied to be a teacher. “In those days in the South, there were two professions open to Black men: You could be a preacher or a teacher.”"",""He planned to teach industrial arts because, hey, he could sure wield those pliers. "",""Dentistry had never entered his mind. "",""Now, in life, there are all kinds of luck: Dumb luck and blind luck, bad luck and good luck and hard luck. In Chester Moody’s life, three lucky breaks changed his destiny. "",""The first: After graduating from Alcorn College in 1960, he went to St. Paul, Minnesota, to visit family. “Now, my aunt was taking my cousins to get their teeth cleaned, and she said, “You come too, Chester,” and we got there, to the Mayo Clinic, and this dentist did the exam after my cleaning and said, ‘Whoever extracted that back molar did a terrible job, he left the root tips in.’  I laughed and told him that was me.” "",""That dentist, Dr. Louie T. Austin, was the director of dental services at the Mayo Clinic, and “he fell in love with me for my story,” Moody recalls. ” He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.”"",""Dr. Austin offered Moody a job in his lab, and taught him the trade. “This guy was the greatest teacher in the world. That’s where I got started, in the laboratory, and fell in love with it. “"",""Moody worked for Dr. Austin a few years, until he was drafted into the United States Army."",""“I was going to defect to Canada, but my mom wept and wept, and so I said I wouldn’t go, and reluctantly stepped over the line.”"",""And here comes the second piece of luck. “I finished basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was scheduled to be sent to North Carolina to learn artillery. Three days before I was supposed to go, I get called into the orderly room where you get your orders.”"",""Even today, 60 years later, his face beams with delight as he quotes his commanding officer: “Private Moody, your orders have been changed; you are going to SAN FRANCISCO, to LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL. They need a dental technician.”  "",""He said he stopped listening after “San Francisco,” because he was so excited. He and a buddy had been planning a cross-country trip out here. “I called Jim immediately and I said, ‘Guess what? I am going to San Francisco, and my ticket is being paid by YOUR UNCLE!  Your UNCLE SAM!’”  "",""The staff dental technician at Letterman was being sent to Vietnam, and Moody was his replacement."",""Moody arrived in San Francisco in February 1963. "",""He lived in barracks at the Presidio. “Imagine waking up every morning and out your window, YOUR WINDOW, you are looking at the prettiest sight you ever saw, the Golden Gate Bridge.”"",""On weekends, he and his buddies explored California. “We went north, we went all along the south coast, we went east. Oh, I was in the service, yes, but I was enjoying EVERY MINUTE OF IT!“"",""Even today, after 60 years in San Francisco, Moody’s speech is molasses-thick with the cadences of Mississippi. His manner is courtly, and he is sturdily built, with powerful arms and hands. He looks much younger than his 84 years, and he often cracks up when he tells his story."",""He had always intended to return to Minnesota after his service, but he met his wife, Georgette, in San Francisco.  “There were two ladies in the waiting room at the dental clinic at Letterman, and I overheard them discussing issues with their daughters. I went up and said, ‘Tell you what, you give me your daughters’ phone numbers and I’ll take them out and tell you what’s up with them!’ One lady sniffed, ‘NO WAY!’ but the other lady gave me Georgette’s number.”"",""They met in February 1965, and were married that May. Though they divorced in 1980, they remain good friends and have three children, now in their 50s, seven grandchildren and two great-grandkids. His second marriage, to Cora, born in Mississippi like himself, “and the world’s greatest cook,” lasted until her death in 2008.  "",""Coming out of the army, he recalls, “I rented a two-bedroom on Golden Gate and Steiner for $135 a month, and got a job right away” at $75 a week at Pacific West Lab, in the building where he works today. “I told the owner I would only work there till the snow melts in Minnesota.”"",""Moody smiles, “I tell people the snow never melted, so I stayed in San Francisco.” "",""Pacific West Lab was busy. A hundred dental technicians worked there. Hawaii had no lab back then, so they also serviced all the dentists in Hawaii."",""“Every Monday, three gigantic mailbags arrived from Hawaii, filled with dentures that needed fixing.”"",""Except for a few years at a lab in Oakland, Moody has worked at 450 Sutter his whole career. "",""And now, the third great stroke of luck: A friendship that lasted 60 years and changed his life. Roman Braunfeld was a Polish Jew, a holocaust survivor. He weighed 60 pounds, had TB, and was almost dead when the U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald, where he was a prisoner. One of the American soldiers who rescued him was a Black sergeant, also named Chester. "",""Braunfeld recovered in Switzerland, learned the dental technology trade, married, and emigrated to the United States in 1953."",""Moody and Braunfeld had an instant rapport, a deep and abiding mutual respect. They worked together until their lab was bought out. Braunfeld left and started his own lab, Far West Dental, in 1970, on another floor; Moody followed shortly."",""In addition to a thriving business, Braunfeld did pro bono work for those who couldn’t afford it, including recovering addicts at Delancey Street who had lost teeth to drugs."",""They worked together until Braunfeld’s death in 2016. In 2006, Braunfeld sold the lab to Moody and his coworker, Lily Louie, age 65. Today, the pair work full time and employ four to five people, but it’s increasingly hard to find skilled craftspeople. The City College program from which Lily Louie graduated 40 years ago has closed. Much of the work is sent to China and other overseas labs, according to Moody."",""Moody ‘s small studio is a throwback to an earlier time."",""To get business, he goes around the building and visits patients in their dentists’ chairs. “I see 12 to 14 patients a day: I match tooth color, I design partials, and sometimes their dentures aren’t fitting right and the dentist will say, ‘Well, what can we do here, Chet?’“"",""Moody takes great pride and pleasure in his work. He sees it as a public service and an art. He tells the story of a 19-year-old patient, born with a terrible cleft palate. Moody manufactured an upper denture that was flexible enough to fold up to squeeze through the tight opening of his mouth. "",""“I have incredible non-book knowledge that Dr. Austin taught me,” he says.  “For instance, take your two front teeth. I was taught that from the top of your head to the bottom of your chin, the length of the front teeth should be one-sixteenth of that measurement.  Back in the 60’s, you could get dentists to give you that measurement for a patient, but they don’t do that anymore.”"",""When asked about retirement, he gestures around the busy lab. The place hums and buzzes with the sounds of grinding and polishing. “I am having too much fun to quit.” "",""On his break-room table are boxes of assorted chocolates and gourmet cookies, various sweets, all with thank you cards from grateful clients and dentists. “Help yourself,” he tells a visitor, “more work for me.”"",""""}",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/pulling-his-own-tooth-with-a-pair-of-pliers-started-a-career-jim-crow-south-dental/

Around it, a flow of pedestrians and bicycles stream through the intersection, hardly noticing the felled former silk oak."",""But the stump is new; it’s the remnant of a silk oak — which, despite its name, is not an oak at all but part of a completely different family of trees — that city crews cut down on March 16. Its exact age and height were not recorded by the city, but it was at least 30 years old and 50 feet tall, according to an estimate by Allegra Mautner, a Public Works urban forestry inspector who has kept an eye on the tree. "",""“It was kind of sad,” said Cassandra, who works at the nearby Fellow Barber. “It was just here one day, and then it was gone the next.”"",""The tree’s death sentence was issued only after multiple discussions, “because it’s such a high-profile tree, and it’s so important to a lot of members of the community,” said Mautner. Earlier, she discussed the issue with multiple supervisors at San Francisco Public Works before defining the tree a hazard that needed to be removed. "",""“It’s a very respectful tree,” said Mautner, who’s now going through a process of coming to terms with the decision. “Every time I biked past that tree after I made that decision, I always felt like, ‘Am I making the right decision?’”"",""The coup de grâce for the silk oak came in February during a series of windstorms. It dropped several large limbs, and that was that. "",""In addition, the tree’s excessive size had rendered its surrounding sidewalk a tripping hazard, impassable for people with disabilities. This constricted foot traffic and activities at a busy intersection, according to Mautner, one of San Francisco’s five urban forestry inspectors who collectively oversee the city’s roughly 125,000 street trees."",""“This tree is very close to me,” she said. She has lived about a block from the silk oak since 2012, and she bikes past it every day on her commute. She took a longer look at the tree during the pandemic, when she did a lot of walking. She noticed the tree because it was a species she had never seen before. "",""But that was also one of the factors necessitating its removal. “It had very poor structure, which is common for this species,” Mautner said. Plus, because of frequent failures of small limbs, the tree’s crown had grown much smaller over the past several years. Its roots also topped the sidewalk, and became more unstable after the recent storms washed out some of the soil underneath. "",""“We really do try to maintain large trees in the urban environment, because they add so many benefits. but we also have to balance the risk that they pose to the public,” Mautner said. Throughout the years, the urban forestry team had added some asphalt patches to temporarily fix the area around the oak. These had degraded over time. City officials also considered a longer term-fix of doing more sidewalk work, but that was deemed infeasible because of the tree’s massive root structure."",""Its size also prevented it from being transplanted. And even if moving the tree were an option, its deteriorating health made the odds of it surviving a transplant low."",""Mautner conducted a final assessment in February, and deemed the silk oak a hazard. “I’m such a tree hugger. Then I have people who tell me that I’m such a tree hater, and I want to remove all the trees in San Francisco,” said the 34-year-old University of California, Berkeley, forestry major. "",""Between Feb. 12 to 27, tree removal notifications were posted on its trunk, on the street light posts around it, and on the Public Works website. With an annual tree mortality rate of four percent in San Francisco, Mautner posts new removal notices almost every week to let the community know in advance that a tree is leaving. "",""No one protested. "",""Mautner took some selfies with the silk oak when she knew it would soon be gone.

He brought out the burial register and baptismal records, and we found my ancestors,” he said. "",""Galvan’s ancestor, Liberato Culpecse, was baptized in 1801 at Mission Dolores, but later moved to Mission San Jose. Culpecse’s parents, Jobocme and Poylemja, are buried in the mission’s cemetery, along with 5,700 other indigenous people, in unmarked graves. After seeing their names in these 200-year-old books, Galvan started thinking about ways to make all those ancestors more visible. "",""“I’ve collected the names of the Indians who were here during the Mission period,” Galvan said one afternoon in January, sitting in the pews of the old mission church. “Originally, I thought I could add an adobe wall and create plaques with all of the names. But even in 1992, it would have cost $1 million.”"",""Today, Galvan hopes to build a new, bigger museum on the Mission Dolores property that would include space for a plaque bearing the 5,700 names. The mission already has a small, one-room museum, but this one would extend into the adjacent playground for Mission Dolores Academy — which is part of the mission property, and was built over part of the mission’s cemetery. But the price tag has gone up: Galvan estimates the museum would cost $3 million to $4 million to build, and has only received donations covering a fraction of that amount. "",""As he pursues his quest, Galvan said he’ll need to reach out to local tribal groups to get their input. "",""“It would be a wonderful way for us to bring it into conversation, their actual names,” said Corinna Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in Oakland, the only local tribal group to respond to Mission Local’s requests for comment. “Giving them names helps to humanize them, which has been difficult for a long time in the Bay Area.”"",""Indigenous people have lived on the San Francisco peninsula for more than 13,000 years. In San Francisco, the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in several villages, including one near the present-day mission site, called Chutchui, on the banks of a waterway they named Ehwate. When Franciscan monks, under the guidance of Junipero Serra, arrived in 1776, they decided that Chutchui was the perfect site to build a mission. "",""The Franciscans forced indigenous residents into labor. The mission church and other structures, including barns and barracks, were constructed by indigenous hands; not just Ohlone, but also Pomo, Miwok, Patwin and Wappo people from the wider Bay Area. "",""Missionaries baptized the indigenous people who lived and worked at the mission, stripping them of their given names and rebranding them with Spanish ones. The hard work, near-starvation rations and waves of infectious illness killed thousands of indigenous people at the site. Galvan wants their names — their indigenous names — to be known again. "",""Facing the steep cost of creating a memorial in the ‘90s, Mission leaders put Galvan’s memorial plaque idea on the back burner. O’Connor moved to another post in 1997, and it wasn’t until Galvan was hired as the mission’s curator in 2004 that he picked up the idea again. He wrote a number of proposals and grant requests, including one to the California Missions Foundation for what he called an “Indian memorial” at Mission Dolores. "",""“The response I got from the committee was, “What about the names of the Spanish and Irish people buried there?’” Galvan recalled. “I said, ‘It says Indian memorial.’” The grant wasn’t approved. "",""In 2009, the mission hired Galvan’s cousin, Vincent Medina (who’s now co-founder of Cafe Ohlone in Berkeley) as assistant curator, and the cousins took matters into their own hands. They bought a pair of redwood boards from Home Depot and carved the names of Jobocme and Poylemja — who are Medina’s ancestors, too — into the wood. They now stand in the mission cemetery. "",""“The grave marker in the center of the cemetery is a tangible piece that visitors, community members, and family members can visit that gives proof to specific Native people buried at Mission Dolores. It gives recognition to two of the individuals that are interred there, and even without much label copy tells a story that is necessary to tell,” Galvan and Medina wrote in an academic article published in 2018. "",""In that article, they proposed projecting the indigenous dead’s names onto a wall at Mission Dolores. That, too, proved difficult and expensive: None of the mission’s current spaces are quite dark enough, and the projector would burn through about $150 a month in lightbulbs. "",""In any case, “I want something permanent, and having it adjacent to the graves makes the most sense,” Galvan said. In 2022, he assisted in creating a similar monument at the Franciscan mission in Sonoma, which reads, “In this sacred grounds lie buried men, women and children of the local Coast Miwok, Patwin, Wappo and Pomo tribes. They built, labored and died at Mission San Francisco Solano.” The site includes a stone etched with the names of 896 indigenous people buried there. "",""Burying people in the ground and marking them with individual stones isn’t the traditional way local indigenous people honor their ancestors, though many do it that way today, said Gould, the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust co-founder. Historically, most buried their dead in large shellmounds that were built up with seashells, earth and other materials, and located them within their villages, so the living wouldn’t be separated from them, she said."",""Sogorea Te’ works in the East Bay to reclaim local land and steward it in indigenous ways. Recently, the nonprofit opened ‘Ookwe Park through an adopt-a-park program in Richmond, where tribes will grow and harvest medicinal plants, including yerba buena, mugwort, wild strawberries and soaproot. The site once held a shellmound, which was destroyed in the construction of the Officer Bradley Moody Memorial Underpass, Gould said."",""It also purchased the embattled West Berkeley Shellmound site in March, formerly the location of a village and massive shellmound that covered many city blocks, all the way to the waterfront. The group plans to unearth Strawberry Creek, currently streaming underground, and build a new, poppy-covered shellmound that visitors can climb. "",""“We can show the magnitude of what a shellmound was. People can stand up high and see, similar to what my ancestors would have seen,” Gould said. The site will represent “not just the past and the horrific things that happened, but the resilience.” "",""Although Gould thinks Galvan is on the right track, she called the Mission Dolores memorial “a first step.” The Catholic Church extensively harmed the indigenous people of California, and owes them “some kind of reciprocity,” or even giving Chutchui land back to the Ramaytush Ohlone, she said. "",""Jonathan Cordero, founder and executive director of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, said the organization is working on some land-back initiatives in San Francisco, but none involving the Mission Dolores area. He declined to comment on the memorial plan."",""For now, it’s unclear whether Mission Dolores will be able to raise enough money to bring its indigenous dead back into the light. Donations of any amount are welcome, Galvan said. "",""Disclosure: Beth Winegarner donates a small amount of money each year to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust and the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone.""}",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mission-dolores-curator-aims-to-humanize-sites-indigenous-dead/

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area."",""The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. "",""The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed."",""The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. "",""The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive."",""There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact."",""This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space."",""What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. "",""The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?"",""Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two."",""Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing."",""The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. "",""The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. "",""The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time."","" The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis."",""San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. "",""Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.""}",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes."",""Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   "",""… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   "",""Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. "",""If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. "",""Huh. Imagine that."",""Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  "",""Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. "",""In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. "",""Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. "",""1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely "",""2 cups of water"",""½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well "",""1½ cups water "",""½ teaspoon salt (optional)"",""2 teaspoons oil, any type"",""¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces"",""¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained"",""or "",""¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained"",""First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately.

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!"",""I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite."",""You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me."",""Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff."",""Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up."",""Vince Yuen

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  "",""“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”"",""Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. "",""“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”"",""The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. "",""The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. "",""The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ""}",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
c8edf9bc-f6c6-4ef6-b9b8-6c0102d3e877,news,richmond,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"{""Spring Market is Upon Us"",""2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air."",""Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future."",""Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see."",""However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future."",""The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season."",""If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal."",""Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do."",""As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition."",""There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers."",""First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for."",""Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house."",""If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before."",""Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them."",""Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever."",""Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible."",""John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime."",""Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset."",""Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety."",""Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City."",""She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved."",""Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls."",""Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset."",""Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business."",""Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference."",""“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”"",""Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval"",""I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction."",""The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden."",""Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses."",""The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back."",""That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City."",""It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit."",""We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies."",""Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants."",""The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue."",""Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous."",""If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year."",""Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates."",""We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue."",""Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all."",""This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events."",""Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He can be reached at engardiostaff@sfgov.org.""}",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/city-hall-joel-engardio-11/

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”"",""Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square)."",""“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”"",""Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded."",""“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added."",""Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016."",""Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”"",""“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”"",""The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene."",""“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”"",""The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside."",""The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program."",""Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time."",""“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”"",""Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location."",""“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”"",""Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area."",""The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice."",""Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com.

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!"",""I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A.

Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite."",""You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood.

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area."",""The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. "",""The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed."",""The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. "",""The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive."",""There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact."",""This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space."",""What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. "",""The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?"",""Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two."",""Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing."",""The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. "",""The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. "",""The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time."","" The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis."",""San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. "",""Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.""}",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes."",""Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   "",""… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   "",""Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. "",""If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan.

It is toxic, pollutes the environment and poses a danger to all San Franciscans. The plastic grass is continually shedding micro-plastics and can’t be recycled or disposed of in a landfill. Phil Ginsburg, the General Manager of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, and Mark Buell, former President of the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Commission, are directly responsible for the presence of artificial turf in our parks. To this day, artificial turf and rubberized surfaces are being installed in playing fields and playgrounds. Micro-plastic pollution is a threat to all life on the planet.

PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” since they accumulate in the body and do not break down. They have been linked to endocrine disruption and cancer. Children are especially vulnerable to harm from PFAS because of their developing bodies and the chemicals’ persistence in the body.  Most people think manufacturers must prove that chemicals are safe before they put them on the market.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  "",""Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. "",""In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. "",""Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. "",""1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely "",""2 cups of water"",""½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well "",""1½ cups water "",""½ teaspoon salt (optional)"",""2 teaspoons oil, any type"",""¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces"",""¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained"",""or "",""¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained"",""First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside."",""In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. "",""Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done."",""Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated.

Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”"",""As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. "",""Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. "",""“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” "",""After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. "",""“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. "",""Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. "",""“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” "",""“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” "",""“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” "",""“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” "",""The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park.

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  "",""“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”"",""Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. "",""“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”"",""The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. "",""The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. "",""The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ""}",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
88615e13-931d-4df2-8be0-b36d04d58866,news,sunset,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"{""Spring Market is Upon Us"",""2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air."",""Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future."",""Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see."",""However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future."",""The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season."",""If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal."",""Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do."",""As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition."",""There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers."",""First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for."",""Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house."",""If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before."",""Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them."",""Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever."",""Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible."",""John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime."",""Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset."",""Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety."",""Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City."",""She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved."",""Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls."",""Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset."",""Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business."",""Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference."",""“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”"",""Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval"",""I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction."",""The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden."",""Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses."",""The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back."",""That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City."",""It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit."",""We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies."",""Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants."",""The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue."",""Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous."",""If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year."",""Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates."",""We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue."",""Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all."",""This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events."",""Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He can be reached at engardiostaff@sfgov.org.""}",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/city-hall-joel-engardio-11/

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”"",""Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square)."",""“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”"",""Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded."",""“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added."",""Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016."",""Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”"",""“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”"",""The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene."",""“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”"",""The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside."",""The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program."",""Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time."",""“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”"",""Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location."",""“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”"",""Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area."",""The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice."",""Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com.

The grassroots group “Keep The Waterfront Open” collected more than 2,500 signatures opposing plans that would remove boats located at Gashouse Cove — part of the Marina Small Craft Harbor since the 1960s — so that PG&E can “decontaminate the water.” Along with removal of the wooden slips and the only public fuel dock in town, the view of bobbing masts would be gone forever.<br><br>Critics say the plan is really about the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department’s desire to accommodate much larger yachts, which would further restrict views from the Marina Green but would increase revenue flow to the agency, all while allowing PG&E to save millions by doing a less than adequate cleanup of its toxins under the water of the adjacent Gashouse Cove.<br><br>With Stefani abstaining, the city charter says “the privilege of the floor shall not be granted, for any purpose, to persons other than officers of the City or their duly authorized representatives.

Add to that the challenge of high rents; hiring; crime; and the pandemic, which forced the closure of many businesses, owning or opening a small business in the city is challenging. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20 percent of new businesses fail, and some reports are that it is higher in San Francisco.<br><br>There may be hope: Earlier this year, Mayor London Breed proposed legislation to improve the permitting process with more than 100 changes to the current Planning Code. Among the proposed changes are allowing more business uses on ground floors to help fill commercial vacancies; lifting restrictions on restaurants and bars in certain neighborhoods — including Union Street; easing the legalization process for existing outdoor patios; and enabling nighttime entertainment, bars, and restaurants to benefit from priority permit processing.<br><br>The legislation is in part designed to provide small businesses the ability to adapt to a “flexible retail” model, which currently is allowed only in certain districts, and would accommodate changing circumstances, such as the pandemic and consumer behavior.

a6eafc2b-9415-44d4-9ce0-7eac36493df2,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 23, 2024, 3:01 PM",Mark Farrell’s pitch to voters? ‘Common sense.’,,"Three times within an hour, San Francisco mayoral hopeful Mark Farrell called on voters to use “common sense” to decide on their stance on city issues. <br><br>“San Francisco is moving away from just being ideological, this left and right, progressive and moderate,” Farrell said last night, to a sold-out crowd at Manny’s cafe in conversation with Mission Local’s managing editor, Joe Eskenazi. “Let’s just have common sense again.”<br><br>Farrell, like Daniel Lurie and Ahsha Safaí in earlier conversations, expressed his frustration with the city’s status quo, and strived to differentiate himself from the rest of the field, stacked with candidates who will be making their appeals to the same set of moderate voters. In particular, he proposed to remove all large homeless encampments in six months, wean downtown San Francisco off of its dependence on the tech industry, increase police staffing levels and open 24/7 clinics for drug users. <br><br>But, like others, he contrasted the San Francisco of today with earlier, better times. In the old days, if you told someone you were from San Francisco, said the 50-year-old San Francisco native, “It was met with a sense of awe, a sense of wonderment, even envy. And today you get, ‘Are you okay?’”<br><br>As he sees it, San Francisco’s public safety, street conditions and economy have never been worse. And that’s mostly due to a “plain and simply failed leadership,” said Farrell. San Francisco used to have more than 2,300 police officers when Ed Lee was the mayor and Farrell was a supervisor, he said. The same number now stands at 1,857, according to the police department. Farrell mentioned former District Attorney Chesa Boudin for demoralizing the police department. <br><br>“Since I left office, our population has declined,”  he said. “So inherently, crime should decline because of that on its face.”<br><br>The crime rate, however, did decline. San Francisco saw fewer cases of both property crimes and violent crimes in 2023 than 2018, the year Farrell left office. <br><br>“We need to have law enforcement in San Francisco, just on principle, to create a civil society, to make sure there is deterrent,” he said. “In San Francisco, at times in the past, that has been foreign. But I think it’s just common sense that needs to be brought back.”<br><br>Farrell argued that his 7.5 years at City Hall — seven years as District 2 supervisor and six months as mayor after Ed Lee died — had equipped him with “a consistent track record” that voters could predict his performance in office. <br><br>To him, Mayor London Breed’s track record has been inconsistent on a number of issues. Regarding the abandoned downtown, he said Breed’s ideas make the city look disorganized: “What we heard was week one, we’re going to build science labs. Week two, we’re going to build housing. Week three, it was a U.C. campus, and then it became a soccer stadium.” <br><br>Michael Petrelis, who is running for District 9 supervisor, disrupted the conversation early on from outside the cafe, holding a sign that read “Ban cars now!” and interjecting frequently. He blared criticisms of Farrell from a bullhorn, but the volume on the speakers’ microphones was turned up, and Petrelis left after some 20 minutes. (We reported earlier that Petrelis attempted to shut down the event and left because he was tired. Petrelis wrote in an email, “My goal was not to stop the conversation and my cameraman had to leave because he had a date. I didn’t leave because I was tired.”<br><br>Macy’s recent closure announcement “caught the mayor’s office off guard, and City Hall off guard,” said Farrell, who noted similar situations also happened with Nordstrom and the San Francisco Centre’s closure. <br><br>Farrell said Breed’s office does not have relationships with the city’s largest tenants, largest building owners and the equity and debt behind them. This situation wouldn’t have happened if he were mayor, he said. He wouldn’t have been blindsided, and would’ve brought everyone together and worked out a solution comprehensively, he said. <br><br>As for plans for a downtown recovery, Farrell said he would first focus on addressing public safety and street conditions, to create an environment where employers and employees would be willing to come back.<br><br>“Diversification” was his diagnosis for downtown in the long term. “You know, we were over-reliant on the tech industry,” said Farrell. <br><br>“To the point where everyone wore the same vest,” noted Eskenazi.<br><br>“I’m glad I didn’t wear mine tonight,” said Farrell, who sported a black suit and white button-down. He noted that the tech industry’s tendency to work from home has turned San Francisco’s downtown into a veritable ghost town. <br><br>How would the public sector fix things that it neither created nor broke? Eskenazi asked.<br><br>The power of tax incentives, Farrell answered. In 2011, Mayor Lee and the Board of Supervisors, including Farrell, managed to use tax breaks to attract Twitter to revitalize mid-Market. “But it didn’t work. We learned our lessons as well,” he said. <br><br>Twitter brought a Silicon Valley model campus to San Francisco, having an in-house gym, an in-house cafe and even in-house dry cleaning, which prevented the surrounding neighborhoods from benefiting much, he said. “If we do this again, we have to do it in a much different, much smarter way,” he said. <br><br>“I think unless we’re aggressive about [reviving downtown], we’re going to lose downtown forever in a potential way,” he said. <br><br>Farrell also wants cars back on Market Street. “Let’s just have common sense again,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to admit that taking cars off Market Street, it’s not a panacea.”<br><br>“Market Street hasn’t been safer, statistically, since we took cars off Market Street,” Farrell said. <br><br>Contrasting Farrell’s citation of statistics regarding street safety — but not crime, in which people “feel” less safe in spite of statistically lower levels, Eskenazi quipped “But I feel safer.” <br><br>As for this week’s tragic car collision at West Portal which killed a family of four, Farrell said the lesson he drew was that the city should be “very granular” about every single intersection. He said he learned from friends who live in West Portal that, prior to the accident, the local community had sent multiple emails to the city saying it was a dangerous intersection, emails that went unheeded.<br><br>When asked who he would fire as mayor, Farrell mentioned the head of SFMTA, Jeffrey Tumlin, to promote public transportation, bicycling and pedestrian safety. In particular, he mentioned SFMTA’s L Taraval Project. “You tore up the street. You took away every single parking spot in the name of increasing the time or decreasing the time it will take for a trolley to get down the road and down. But you know what you’re also doing? Killing. You’re killing a lot of small businesses,” he said. <br><br>And Police Chief Bill Scott, whom Farrell called “a very good man” who had simply been in the position too long. “At the end of the day, the average tenure of a police chief in the U.S. is three years, and he has been here for almost eight,” Farrell said. <br><br>Farrell also intends to back city charter reform on November’s ballot, to guarantee the mayor always has the power to fire or hire department heads in a “plain and simple” way. This week, Farrell created a political action committee to push two ballot measures that would do just that, while also allowing the mayoral candidate to seek unlimited campaign donations to ostensibly back those ballot measures.<br><br>Asked whether he would support Breed’s recent veto of Board President Aaron Peskin’s legislation limiting density in areas of his district, Farrell said he would.<br><br>“I need you to speak loudly so the people in District 2 can hear you,” Eskenazi said. Would they want 270-foot high-rises in their neighborhoods? <br><br>It’s not about housing, but about “sloppy legislation” inside City Hall, said Farrell. “We had last summer’s density increases that everyone agreed upon. We come a few months later and say, ‘Whoops, I didn’t mean that we’re going to density decrease.’”<br><br>Farrell sought to sidestep a pro-housing or anti-housing characterization, falling back on his “common sense” pitch.<br><br>“Where is this common sense, once again?” said Farrell. “This gets back to the YIMBY, NIMBY, different sides of the aisle, where it’s just a zero-sum game and somebody has to win. Unless you’re fully with us, you’re off the boat.”<br><br>“I do not believe that we need to upzone every single neighborhood in San Francisco,” he added, saying it is the wrong approach. “As is the approach to say that we’re not going to build anywhere in San Francisco. We can do it in a very smart manner.”<br><br>Farrell also promised to take out all the large homeless encampments in six months by offering residents shelter, which he did as mayor in 2018, he said. <br><br>He suggested having clinics for substance use care open 24/7. “We have to capture [drug users] when they’re willing to make a different decision. And to give them a chance for a better life,” he said.<br><br>And, on Day One, he would audit all of the San Francisco nonprofits working on homelessness, because the city is funding a large amount of overlapping services, he said. There could be as many as nine city departments that fund homeless spending, he said. “Many fund the same nonprofit, but don’t realize that they’re doing it, and have different metrics for how they’re measuring success.”<br><br>Asked which past mayor he would seek to emulate, Farrell pointed to traits of several different city leaders. Farrell appreciated former Mayor Willie Brown’s ability to simply get things done, he said, and Gavin Newsom’s bold approach to politics and policy. He aspired to Ed Lee’s patience and Dianne Feinstein’s genuine love of San Francisco. <br><br>He chose not to answer who his ranked-choice alliance would be, saying it was premature, but acknowledged that it would be a part of any mayoral candidate’s strategy. <br><br>If elected, Farrell, who was the longest-serving Board of Supervisors budget chair in San Francisco’s history, will also be one of the first — if not the first — mayors of a major American city who is a venture capitalist. His finance background, he said, would be “super relevant” to the fate of San Francisco, a city that has a projected budget deficit of $728 million in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, and a 36 percent office-vacancy rate. <br><br>“It is amazing to me that what City Hall is turning to is just a blame game … No one’s willing to take leadership and accountability,” he said. “We need that back in San Francisco if we’re going to bring our city back.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mark-farrells-common-sense/

ASCARRUNZ,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:40 AM","Review: Foliage, Precita Park spot offering prix fixe menu, can do better",,"Foliage opened in October 2023 in the space vacated by Michelin-starred Marlena, which has since moved to Japantown as the already acclaimed Adams 7 — Japantown’s gain, our loss. <br><br>Foliage owners Stephane Roulland and Julia Indovina brought in Chef Mo Béjar to the beautiful corner space by Precita Park. When my editor asked me to review the new restaurant at their publicist’s request, I was salivating at the prospect of trying another somewhat affordable ($75) prix-fixe menu in the area. Béjar hails from the Central Valley, and his dishes have the requisite farm-to-table, sustainable and beautiful aesthetic, and they sounded interesting and fresh, with a few culinary twists and turns. <br><br>We started out with the house-made milk bread with cultured butter. The other option was the bread with a spiced salt and Spanish jamón, but we went for the basic. <br><br>This gorgeous golden orb came to the table, warm and inviting, with a very generous slab of butter, gleaming with crystals of crunchy salt. Plenty for us to have two wedges apiece, the interior was fluffy and yeasty, and gave us high hopes for the rest of the meal. Besides, who ever gives you enough butter with your bread? <br><br>The prix-fixe menu at Foliage offers two options per course, plus some optional add-ons. We decided to get each of the options, so that we would get to taste everything.<br><br>First course: Amberjack crudo with lacto-fermented pineapple, banana, macadamia nuts, and thinly sliced kohlrabi. <br><br>The vegetarian option: Avocado with essentially the same ingredients.<br><br>Both had a little funk, with an inexplicable paprika oil at the bottom of the bowls. The amberjack was lovely, but it was an odd combination of flavors; banana and fish connote a somewhat Caribbean vibe, but it didn’t really work for us. We were also a bit puzzled about the choice to take the same ingredients and simply substitute avocado for the protein. It seemed to me that here was a perfect, missed opportunity to make a wholly different, inventive vegetarian option. While we weren’t thrilled with the amberjack dish, the vegetarian option was lackluster. <br><br>Second course: Shrimp toast and ricotta gnocchi.<br><br>Beautiful dishes, both. The Foliage shrimp toast was wonderful; super crispy, light, highly spiced, with a Sichuan peppercorn aioli, and perfectly cooked shrimp. I’d get it again (and, in fact, I did). Our only quibble was the Osetra caviar was wasted on this. You literally could not taste it with everything else going on.<br><br>The gnocchi dish came with a lovely gorgonzola sauce, pooled under beautifully wilted and browned sweet cabbage, topped with fried sage and toasted nuts. Unfortunately, the cabbage was the best thing on the plate; the ricotta gnocchi themselves were severely tough and dense. We found them inedible, and when the runner eventually came around to ask if he could take the plate (without asking why the dish was untouched), I told him that the gnocchi were very hard. He apologized profusely and said he would tell the chef. When he returned, he informed us the chef admitted that they were usually softer, and asked if we wanted him to try making them again, or did we want another shrimp toast? Perhaps we should have taken him up on the offer for a re-do, but we took the safe-bet toast. My question is: How does that go out to a table? And were others eating those heavy gnocchi without complaint?<br><br>At that point, the courses seemed to have slowed down. I’d finished a glass of Cremant bubbly, and asked the runner for the list so I could order a glass of wine. He misheard me, and brought another glass of the same sparkling wine. He apologized, and began to take it back, but my sister said she would just take it so it wouldn’t go to waste. She hadn’t planned on having alcohol with dinner. I ordered a very good cabernet.<br><br>Next came our entrée courses. The options were local cod over sweet potato puree with fava greens and charred leeks, or roasted cauliflower with a vadouvan crema for the vegetarian dish. Or, for an additional $15, a coulotte steak (described by our server as “the best cut, the top of the sirloin.”) with mole, chayote, citrus, and chocolate jus. Sold! We ordered the fish and the steak.<br><br>The cod was a bit on the small side, slightly overdone, the skin could have been a little crisper for my taste, but overall had good flavor. The underlying sweet potato puree and leeks were good, the garum (an ancient Roman fish sauce) very subtle. I was busy eating my portion of the fish before switching off with my sister, so I didn’t notice she was having trouble with the steak.<br><br>When they first put the dish on the table, I asked if the thin brown sauce underneath the steak was the mole, and our runner said no, that’s the chocolate jus. A minute later, the chef himself came by with an extra little ramekin of the orange mole, which had been hiding under the chayote. A nice gesture, though I hadn’t asked for more; I just hadn’t seen it on the plate. We chatted with Chef Béjar a few minutes, asked where he’d cooked before, wished him well. <br><br>The steak was rare (which we both like), and I finally noticed my sister sawing away at the meat for an interminable amount of time. She looked at me in disbelief. “You need to cut this into really small pieces, or you won’t be able to chew it.” I tried my hand at it and, sure enough, it took at least 10 seconds to hack free a tiny piece, and then another 10 to chew it until it was soft enough to swallow. Again, we just could not eat it. The Foliage mole itself was — sorry, the only word I can think of is strange — citrusy, and unlike any other mole I’d ever had. The chayote was hard and flavorless. Our server finally came by and asked us how we were enjoying the course as she stared at the full plate. I demonstrated how hard it was to cut through the meat. She replied, “Yes, because it’s a very chewy cut.” Before I could show my amazement at this explanation, she quickly asked if she should take it away and I said “yes, please.”<br><br>In all the time I’ve been reviewing for Mission Local, I really can’t remember sending a dish back, much less two in one meal. By this point, we were looking around at the quite full restaurant and wondering if it was just us? We’re normally not that picky (in fact, I often get accused of liking everything indiscriminately), and we don’t relish making a scene. It was baffling, as no one else seemed to be having an issue, but seemed to be enjoying their meals thoroughly. <br><br>Dessert course: One was a mango semifreddo with tuile crumbles, a little mango jelly, and mint. <br><br>“Semifreddo” means “partially frozen.” The ice cream here, unfortunately, was a solid disk, and we had to wait a bit for it to soften. It tasted fine, however; very subtly mango flavored. <br><br>The other dessert was a white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries. The panna cotta was nicely creamy and, thankfully, not too sweet. All in all, there was nothing wrong with the desserts; they were simply unremarkable.<br><br>And the perfect ending to our meal? As I reached for the bill, my hand hit my glass which still had some wine in it — only my second glass of the evening, mind you — and in dramatic fashion knocked it onto the table, smashing it loudly, flinging wine and bits of glass everywhere. A shard actually drew blood from my sister’s hand. Mortified, I now saw myself through the eyes of our servers and chef: “Oh, was that the drunk woman who complained about everything?” I apologized over and over, all were gracious, mopping up the mess and making light of the incident. The Foliage staff handled it with class and kindness.<br><br>They also graciously took the $15 steak off our bill without my asking, charged us for the wine that was a mistake (which, yes, we’d drank), and handed us a bill for close to $250. <br><br>It truly pains me to write a review like this. Anyone can make a mistake; a bad dish can happen to any kitchen, but don’t send it out. If a cut of beef is so chewy, cook it some other way. The deficiencies in the dishes we disliked were basic errors in execution. I know it is an excruciatingly difficult thing to open, run, and maintain a restaurant for any length of time, in this city, or anywhere. What a feather in Chef Béjar’s cap to have opened in this lovely space, with a ready-made clientele mourning the loss of their beloved Marlena. (NB: I never told anyone at the restaurant that I was reviewing that night, even though we’d been asked to do so.)<br><br>I’m hoping this was simply an anomaly, as I’m rooting for Chef Béjar to achieve success in that space, and for Foliage to become a neighborhood mainstay, as I’m sure the Precita Park community is hoping as well. <br><br>Foliage SF (website)

SFMTA’s plan was released on March 14 as part of the five-year pilot program allowed by the passage of Assembly Bill 645. Six cities, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, will use automated speed cameras to capture images of rear license plates of vehicles that go over the speed limit to penalize motorists in a bid to improve safety.<br><br>“We are anticipating that speed safety cameras are an important part of an overall what can be done on a street but not the only thing,” Hake said. “We believe that they're going to be most effective with engineering changes as well that change the roadway layout or change how fast you can drive on a street.”<br><br>San Francisco will be allotted 33 cameras to be placed around the city. The number is determined by the city’s population. The SFMTA plans to place the cameras in corridors on the high-injury networks, streets where collisions happen the most frequently. Installations are expected to start in the summer.<br><br>Six speed cameras are proposed for Ingleside and nearby neighborhoods: Ocean Avenue from Friday Kahlo Way to Howth Street, San Jose Avenue from Santa Ynez Avenue to Ocean Avenue, Alemany Boulevard from Farragut Avenue to Naglee Avenue, Mission Street from Ottawa Avenue to Allison Street, Geneva Avenue from Prague Street to Brookdale Avenue and Monterey Boulevard from Edna Street to Congo Street.<br><br>“I think the ones that we ended up recommending are the ones that are definitely the strongest because I think this is an opportunity for us to change policy not only in San Francisco but in California,” Hake said.<br><br>Pedestrian and road safety is on NMTIA members’ minds following recent pedestrian fatalities by motor vehicles at the Alemany Boulevard and Rousseau Street intersection in February and the March 16 crash that killed three people beside West Portal Station on Saturday.<br><br>NMTIA recently welcomed a new traffic light at Alemany Boulevard and Theresa Street with other neighbors and District 11 Supervisor Ahsha Safaí on Feb. 24.<br><br>“That’s why the speed cameras, more than anything, are so important to pedestrian and people’s lives because every five to ten miles [per hour] you go up, the probability of death goes up dramatically,” Safaí said.<br><br>Several attendees asked about the cost of this project and how it would work for those caught speeding. Hake said it would be funded through the transportation agency’s operating budget to get a camera vendor and any revenue that is earned will initially go toward covering program costs with any additional income going towards traffic calming improvements.<br><br>Offenders would be charged a penalty at a cost of $50 to $500 depending on how many mph over the speed limit they drive. Violations would also be issued as civil penalties and treated more like tollbooth charges with the ticket going to the individual on the vehicle's registration.<br><br>Sam Thomas, who lives on San Jose Avenue, said a speed camera on Alemany Boulevard is “super important.”<br><br>“Alemany is super dangerous,” Thomas said. “We just had a neighbor who died on Cotter. It’s terrible. Alemany is a whole different beast.”<br><br>The speed camera proposal will go to the SFMTA Board of Directors in April and then on to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in June.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/speed-camera-installation-meeting/

He promised that, as supervisor, he would work with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to identify all danger zones in District 7 and “take precautions to make sure we avoid tragedies like this,” though, in 100 words, he did not specify exactly how. <br><br>The city has failed in its Vision Zero goal: Fatal collisions have increased since 2014, and 2022 saw the most traffic deaths in San Francisco since 2007.<br><br>For Martin-Pinto, it is “important to let the facts come out in this case” before proposing solutions, though he did suggest changing the configuration of bus stops and enforcing traffic regulations. Likewise, the two other candidates noted that lack of traffic enforcement is an issue. <br><br>Traffic enforcement has collapsed across San Francisco since 2014, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Police officers are issuing a small fraction of the citations they did 10 years ago, leading supervisors to hold pointed inquiries into the problem last year. <br><br>Melgar, for her part, pointed to both enforcement and slowing down cars, alongside physical protective infrastructure like bollards. She also went further by suggesting that certain areas around public transportation hubs should be fully pedestrianized and closed to cars altogether. <br><br>Their answers are below, but I also wanted to let you know that I will be in your district on Monday, March 25 at 1 p.m. at Ballast Coffee (329 West Portal Ave.).

Parents and teachers, fearing the district was phasing out the K-8 model, immediately launched an advocacy effort, with around 100 of them showing up at two school district meetings to make impassioned pleas.  <br><br>Just as they were anxiously anticipating the worst news on March 22, when school budgets were due, they instead discovered that three of the four K-8s they advocated for dodged some or all of the proposed cuts.<br><br>San Francisco Community School, a K-8 in the Excelsior, was going to lose its only middle-school physical education teacher and a campus security position for the coming school year. Days after advocates participated in their second school district meeting on March 13, the district let them know that both positions would come back, according to Maia Piccagli, president of the school’s Parent Action Council.<br><br>She wasn’t quite sure exactly why, but thought it had something to do with their advocacy. “I felt amazing, I felt really excited. Honestly, I’ve done a lot of advocacy in my life, but I have rarely seen an immediate change,” she said. “It felt great to have had so many parents involved in making statements and having there be such a quick win afterwards.”<br><br>“We are happy to hear that SFUSD leadership is receiving and applying feedback,” said Frank Lara, executive vice president of United Educators of San Francisco, in a statement.<br><br>The school district, while emphasizing it is “committed to a transparent process for school staffing and budget allocation,” did not specify how the decision had been made.<br><br>SoMa’s Bessie Carmichael School PreK-8 Filipino Education Center also got what its parents and teachers advocated for: The reinstatement of one of the school’s two social workers, who the school district was going to cut. The good news came last Thursday morning — less than two days after the school board meeting, according to the school community. <br><br>Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School’s parents and teachers advocated for seven teaching positions the district had put on the block.  <br><br>The community learned early last week that the school district would reinstate two of their campus security positions, according to principal Claudia Delarios-Moran, who remains uncertain of the reason. These are necessary positions for the school, parents and teachers said, which the school had planned to hire at its own expense in the coming school year.<br><br>While the school district declined to add back the seven teaching positions, the money Buena Vista Horace Man will be able to save from spending on two campus security positions will be used to hire an extra teacher, reducing the casualties from seven to six. The school plans to hire a teacher to help with its fourth and fifth grades with the $157,000 saved, according to Delarios-Moran.<br><br>“I feel relieved, because it allows us to cut one less position,” said Delarios-Moran. “It gets us closer to where we were before in the first place.”<br><br>Twin Peaks’ Rooftop School TK-8 was not as fortunate. The school district informed the school in early March that it would lose one of its kindergarten positions. The school community made comments at the March 4 district advisory meeting, but didn’t show up at the following week’s school board meeting.<br><br>The position was not reinstated.<br><br>“They did not give us our kindergarten class back,” Rooftop Principal Darren Kawaii said last Friday. Kawaii also said he did not know how such decisions were made. <br><br>They might “get it back” the year after, he said, “but it’s not confirmed.” <br><br>Parents and teachers want assurances that “we will definitely get our kindergarten [teacher] back next year,” Kawaii added, but the district “won’t put it in writing whether it’s happening or not.”<br><br>The school district will start discussing school consolidation and closures this Thursday at a virtual town hall. At present, there are eight K-8 schools in San Francisco. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/some-k-8-schools-get-staffers-back-after-advocacy/

The 20-year-old is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl earlier this month while he was employed as an after-school worker at Everett Middle School.<br><br>San Francisco Superior Court Judge Brian L. Ferrall also determined that the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>Reyes, a worker with the nonprofit Mission Graduates’ after-school program, was arrested on March 5 at Everett Middle School following alleged improper contact with a student. He has been in custody since the arrest. <br><br>On March 11, Reyes pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment. His maximum time in prison would be 14 years for the charges, which include three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, unlawful sexual intercourse and contact with a minor for sexual offense, according to court documents. <br><br>A preliminary hearing was held today in Department 13 on the second floor of the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. Only Reyes’ mother and two other family members were in the courtroom’s audience. <br><br>Reyes showed up in an orange jumpsuit and smiled when saw his family members. Throughout the two-hour hearing, Reyes repeatedly looked back to exchange glances with his family, especially his mother. At one point, Reyes mouthed “Love you” to his mother, who nodded in response. <br><br>Deputy public defender Semuteh Freeman, who represents Reyes, said her client was comfortable participating in the hearing in English until a Spanish interpreter was available, saying that Reyes attended school and was educated in English from the age of 13. Two interpreters arrived in the second hour of the hearing and began interpreting the proceedings for Reyes.<br><br>Prosecutor Tanisha Gooch summoned two witnesses today: A San Francisco police officer and a sergeant, who both had first-hand information regarding the case. <br><br>Officer Bryan Santan responded with his partner to the initial call at 12:45 p.m. on March 5 . He spoke with both Principal Alicia Blacknell and the alleged victim in the principal’s office at Everett Middle School. <br><br>Santana said the victim and Reyes had known each other for several months before the alleged rape. They had kissed several times prior to March 5, but had not had a prior sexual relationship. While Santana continued to describe details of the alleged rape, Reyes shook his head. <br><br>The purported victim took the bus to 16th and Mission streets, and then walked to meet Reyes at his nearby apartment, where the alleged rape took place, according to what Santana learned. The victim went to school after leaving Reyes’ apartment. Later, she felt physical pain and messaged Reyes. <br><br>While being interviewed by Officer Santana on March 5, Blacknell identified Reyes as the “boyfriend” the victim had mentioned to her. Santana also identified Reyes in the courtroom today.<br><br>On March 5, the alleged victim told Santana, a certified Spanish translator, that her communication with Reyes was in Spanish. Santana saw several screenshots of the victim’s text messages, in Spanish, with Reyes. He told the court that the principal showed him the screenshots, and he saw them again later after obtaining the alleged victim’s phone. <br><br>Both public defender Freeman and officer Santana agreed today that the resolution of the screenshots presented as exhibits in court today was so low that they were not legible. Still, Santana described what he could remember of the text messages.<br><br>He saw messages, including heart-shaped emojis, in Instagram DMs. He also recalled seeing the background photo of the alleged victim and Reyes’ WhatsApp exchange, which he said both sides could see: “The photo behind the entire series of texts that I was shown appeared to be the victim in a bra, wearing a small pair of jean shorts, looking away from the camera,” Santana said.<br><br>He also recalled the 12-year-old and Reyes calling each other pet names, saying “I love you,” and sending emojis of heart shapes and kisses. Once, Reyes even sent a Spanish sentence that could be roughly translated as “I wanna eat you up,” according to Santana.<br><br>But not every communique between the alleged victim and Reyes was so light. When the 12-year-old informed Reyes of being in pain after sexual intercourse, court documents list his responses as, “I’m sorry for being so hard” and “It only hurts the first time.” <br><br>Santana acknowledged that neither he nor his partner turned their body camera on when they interviewed the 12-year-old on March 5, because of the police department’s policy on such cameras.<br><br>The second witness, Sergeant Daniel Kelly, was assigned the case on March 5, and spoke to the alleged victim about Reyes that evening. According to Kelly, she first met Reyes in late 2023, months before Reyes started working in the after-school program at Everett. When the alleged rape occurred on March 5, the victim was aware that Reyes was working at Everett, and that day was her first visit to Reyes’ apartment.<br><br>Kelly said the 12-year-old named three platforms on which she and Reyes had been communicating: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The girl’s phone has been turned over to the Crime Scene Investigation’s multimedia evidence unit.<br><br>Kelly also interviewed Reyes at Mission Station on March 5 and described Reyes as “calm.” Reyes said he taught art and coached sixth, seventh and eighth grade soccer at Everett. Reyes, who has a young child of his own, said he believed the victim was approximately 16 years old. He also said they were in love with each other; “that nobody has ever made him feel the way Jane Doe has,” said Kelly.  <br><br>He said “other female students [at Everett] had been essentially throwing themselves at him in a romantic sense, trying to give him hugs, trying to locate him on social media, messaging him [so much] that he had to regularly rebuff them,” said Kelly, recounting a conversation with Reyes.<br><br>Reyes acknowledged that he knew the victim was too young to have a sexual relationship with him, Kelly testified.<br><br>Kelly has had difficulty locating the address of the apartment where the alleged rape took place. According to the sergeant, Reyes provided one address, while Kelly and his team found another. <br><br>The victim received medical care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. <br><br>Reyes has been held in jail without bail. “The Defendant is an employee at a middle school, and thus surrounded by potential future victims,” the District Attorney’s Office argued in court documents. <br><br>Attorneys of both parties and Judge Ferrall discussed whether Reyes should be moved to home detention, which Ferrall later dismissed, citing a public-safety risk.<br><br>Public defender Freeman said that, while Reyes did have a prior misdemeanor conviction in Richmond when he was 18, he has no other criminal record. Freeman said he has been shuttled in and out of foster care facilities since he was 13. Once Reyes was incarcerated, he lost the funds to pay rent for his apartment.<br><br>“I’m asking the court to consider the effect of prolonged incarceration on him. I do think that there are other non-carceral ways that the court can ensure public safety,” said Freeman. “I don’t think he’s a flight risk, both because we have a default here, but also because he has a child and mother, and he is co-parenting his child.”<br><br>Freeman also noted that the Central American Resource Center of Northern California has been working with Reyes and his mother on asylum claims.<br><br>“The people are concerned about public safety,” prosecutor Gooch argued. “He’s making comments that the young girls at this middle school who are in grades six through eight, are throwing themselves at him. He acknowledged during his interview that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that the victim was too young, but he did it anyway, because that’s how love works.”<br><br>“I agree he’s not a flight risk, but the risk to public safety, from the evidence I’ve heard, is severe,” said Ferrall, who said the material presented today in court was “extremely troubling.” <br><br>“I can’t say that I’m comfortable with a less restrictive alternative of home detention, given what’s happened, and none of which would have been prevented by him being on electronic monitoring in his apartment,” he added, adding that the fact that the alleged rape happened at Reyes’ home rendered home detention a risk.<br><br>The judge also mentioned that Reyes has inflicted a potentially lifetime impact on the alleged victim. He also found Reyes’ comments of other girls at Everett throwing themselves at him troubling.<br><br>Ferrall discharged the felony charge of sodomy of a person under 18 for lack of evidence. Five felony charges remain.<br><br>After the decisions were made, Reyes broke into tears, lowering his head while his shoulders shook uncontrollably. Reyes’ mother, whose eyes were red from a morning of crying, called out words of encouragement to Reyes in Spanish. <br><br>Ferrall also determined that he had seen enough evidence for Reyes to be held to answer, and the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>The court has prohibited Reyes from coming within 150 yards of the victim or having electronic, written or telephonic contact with the victim, or contacting the victim through a third party other than the attorney.  ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/everett-after-school-worker-accused-of-rape-remains-incarcerated-troubling-material-emerges-in-court/

If so, you’re better informed than many of the folks working this year’s mayoral campaigns — or running in them — who tend to default to ‘a lot.’ <br><br>They’re not wrong, but the Department of Elections informs us that the exact answer is 10. Ten! Can you imagine it? Can you envision the thought process behind parsing your sixth, seventh and eighth choices? It’d be like asking Elizabeth Taylor to rank her ex-husbands (and Liz would complicate her ballot by putting Richard Burton twice). <br><br>Will most San Francisco voters dutifully fill out all 10 spots? Of course not; that’d be a lot to expect out of a voter, especially when, like the roster of a city Little League team, the talent level among the mayoral candidates really drops off after the top four or five. <br><br>So, no, most San Francisco voters will not emulate David Letterman and craft their own Top-10 lists. But the vast majority will be voting for multiple candidates, as the system allows. The national ranked-choice voting advocacy group Fair Vote crunched 20 years of San Francisco data, and noted that the median number of city voters who’ve been opting for multiple candidates is 74 percent. <br><br>That’s a lot of extra votes out there. Candidates neglecting, ignoring or disdaining the voting system we’ve had in place since 2004 are setting themselves up to be neglected, ignored or disdained. And yet, it happens more than you’d think. <br><br>With the dust settling from the March 5 election, we’re entering into a period of what one pithy city player calls “moderate-on-moderate violence.” <br><br>Up in the political heavens, our Masters of the Universe are turning on one another. Some of the billionaires will support the incumbent. But some won’t: Don’t look now, but Mark Farrell established a candidate-controlled committee last week to push the mayoral-strengthening ballot measures from Michael Moritz’s TogetherSF … which also enables Farrell to raise unlimited funds. <br><br>On a more terrestrial plane, the competition for mayoral endorsements will be fierce. And multifaceted. This is a multi-front war. It will be fought over the now moderate-heavy Democratic County Central Committee, the big-money groups spending with sailor-on-liberty ferocity over the last several election cycles, neighborhood and ethnic Democratic clubs, and influential and quasi-influential individuals. When it comes to bending the ears of individual DCCC member-elects, we’re told, “the wooing season has already started.” <br><br>Mayor London Breed’s team has, additionally, made it clear that it is not interested in any dual or ranked endorsements. This is a loaded decree coming from a sitting mayor who’ll be running this town for the next eight-odd months (and may yet win in November). It’d be nice if she picked up the phone for you, right? Political and governmental issues aren’t supposed to bleed into one another, but it often happens here on planet Earth.  <br><br>At this point, this is just a battle over endorsements. Breed’s demand that she and she alone be recognized makes political sense. It does not benefit her to have other people’s names and photos on the campaign brochures she’d rather have featuring her and her alone. That’s hardly unwise or crazy. <br><br>But there’s a difference between consolidating endorsements for a campaign and actually running a campaign. And, at this point, everything seems to point toward the mayor having little interest in engaging with the ranked-choice strategy that has governed San Francisco elections for a generation and will decide this one, whether she likes it or not. <br><br>Do you know what percentage of the time the candidate who wins the most first-place votes goes on to win in a ranked-choice election? According to the data sets over at Fair Vote, it’s around 94 percent. Didn’t Mayor Breed finish first in a 2018 election in which she put minimal effort into a ranked-choice strategy, and then hang on to beat Mark Leno and Jane Kim, who put a maximal effort into such a strategy? Yes, that happened. So what’s the big deal? <br><br>Let’s address the higher-end issue first. Many elections, if not most, are not particularly competitive. If we had a ranked-choice contest on what to have for dinner and the choices were pizza, haggis or Scandinavian aspic, the permutations of RCV would not likely come into play. <br><br>And that leads to the forthcoming San Francisco mayoral election — and how, in some ways, it’s 180 degrees different than the race Breed won in 2018. One thing it certainly isn’t is a pizza-haggis-aspic competition. It seems plain that this one is going to be competitive, and the notion of any of the declared candidates amassing a double-digit first-round lead, as Breed did in 2018, feels more than a bit fanciful. It certainly doesn’t feel like a solid assumption that our deeply unpopular incumbent mayor, who is running in the same ideological lane as two other well-financed competitors, is a lock to finish first at all. <br><br>In that 2018 contest, Leno and Kim each garnered about 60,000 first-place votes. That was a good 30,000 behind Breed — but, combined, the two outpolled her handily. Over the course of eight rounds of ranked-choice tabulations, Leno gained on Breed, eventually losing by just 2,500-odd votes, a 50.55 to 49.45 tilt. <br><br>In 2024, we won’t have two candidates neatly splitting the pie among voters less ideologically inclined to vote for Breed. Rather, now we’ll have multiple candidates on her side of the sandbox, splitting her voters. There is, clearly, a big center-left lane in which to run. Aaron Peskin is biding his time like Godot — And if he doesn’t come? We’ll come back tomorrow. And then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. But it figures he will eventually arrive. Perhaps as soon as April. <br><br>Peskin is in no hurry. Why interrupt this moderate-on-moderate violence? But when he does finally enter, a ranked-choice strategy among his mayoral competitors would seem to be de rigueur. But it remains to be seen if these candidates can get over individual ambitions and personal animosity to agree on anything. Election professionals worry that these sorts of deals, at least early in the election cycle, project weakness. They also give your chosen voter base tacit permission to vote for another candidate. <br><br>Election professionals, however, also know the value of (eventually) forming alliances. Candidates, though, often don’t; candidates can be the most inconvenient part of the electoral process for election professionals. So can voters, who are less ideological than political insiders and, messaging be damned, vote for candidate combinations that don’t make intuitive sense. One casualty of moderate-on-moderate violence may be punch-drunk voters. <br><br>“There should be genuine concern about confusing voters,” a moderate operative tells me. <br><br>Ranked-choice voting needn’t be confusing, but politics often is. In 2018, even up to the penultimate seventh round of ranked-choice tabulations, Kim and Leno held nearly 57 percent of the vote. The electorate, at that time, was clearly leaning progressive, so multiple progressives entered the fray, split the vote, diluted their collective leverage, and the mayoral contest was won by a moderate. It’s funny how that works. <br><br>This year, the electorate would seem to be leaning moderate. And, lo, multiple moderates have entered the fray. Moderates have the clear advantage — and, as a result of that, every individual candidate is incentivized to stay in the race, work for his or her own benefit, and dilute their collective leverage. It has the potential to work out funny again.<br><br>Regardless, it will be fascinating to see what comes next — if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/moderate-on-moderate-violence-sf-mayoral-races-next-act/

Meet Chester Moody.<br><br>It’s 1958 in the Jim Crow South: Lorman, Mississippi, to be precise. He is 17 years old, attending Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college, and he is in excruciating pain. At the administration office, he is told it will be 21 days before a dentist visits the college, and Black students can’t leave campus.<br><br>So, young Chester Moody broke into the campus woodshop, borrowed a pair of pliers, and performed his own extraction.<br><br>“It took me a while to get the courage, but the moment I clamped the pliers around that molar, the pain went away,” recalls Moody, 84, from his dental lab on the 16th floor of the downtown Sutter Street Medical/Dental Building, where he fabricates dental prosthetics, including dentures, implants and more. “I now know that it was the gas escaping, but I couldn’t walk around with pliers coming out of my mouth. I was screwing up my courage to pull, and suddenly there was a snap and the top part of the tooth was gone! Oh, the smell was terrible, but the relief was instant.”<br><br>Born in 1939 in Coffeeville, Mississippi, Moody studied to be a teacher. “In those days in the South, there were two professions open to Black men: You could be a preacher or a teacher.”<br><br>He planned to teach industrial arts because, hey, he could sure wield those pliers. <br><br>Dentistry had never entered his mind. <br><br>Now, in life, there are all kinds of luck: Dumb luck and blind luck, bad luck and good luck and hard luck. In Chester Moody’s life, three lucky breaks changed his destiny. <br><br>The first: After graduating from Alcorn College in 1960, he went to St. Paul, Minnesota, to visit family. “Now, my aunt was taking my cousins to get their teeth cleaned, and she said, “You come too, Chester,” and we got there, to the Mayo Clinic, and this dentist did the exam after my cleaning and said, ‘Whoever extracted that back molar did a terrible job, he left the root tips in.’ I laughed and told him that was me.” <br><br>That dentist, Dr. Louie T. Austin, was the director of dental services at the Mayo Clinic, and “he fell in love with me for my story,” Moody recalls. “He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.”<br><br>Dr. Austin offered Moody a job in his lab, and taught him the trade. “This guy was the greatest teacher in the world. That’s where I got started, in the laboratory, and fell in love with it. “<br><br>Moody worked for Dr. Austin a few years, until he was drafted into the United States Army.<br><br>“I was going to defect to Canada, but my mom wept and wept, and so I said I wouldn’t go, and reluctantly stepped over the line.”<br><br>And here comes the second piece of luck. “I finished basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was scheduled to be sent to North Carolina to learn artillery. Three days before I was supposed to go, I get called into the orderly room where you get your orders.”<br><br>Even today, 60 years later, his face beams with delight as he quotes his commanding officer: “Private Moody, your orders have been changed. You are going to SAN FRANCISCO, to LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL. They need a dental technician.”  <br><br>He said he stopped listening after “San Francisco,” because he was so excited. He and a buddy had been planning a cross-country trip out here. “I called Jim immediately and I said, ‘Guess what? I am going to San Francisco, and my ticket is being paid by YOUR UNCLE!  Your UNCLE SAM!’”  <br><br>The staff dental technician at Letterman was being sent to Vietnam, and Moody was his replacement.<br><br>Moody arrived in San Francisco in February 1963. <br><br>He lived in barracks at the Presidio. “Imagine waking up every morning and out your window, YOUR WINDOW, you are looking at the prettiest sight you ever saw, the Golden Gate Bridge.”<br><br>On weekends, he and his buddies explored California. “We went north, we went all along the south coast, we went east. Oh, I was in the service, yes, but I was enjoying EVERY MINUTE OF IT!“<br><br>Even today, after 60 years in San Francisco, Moody’s speech is molasses-thick with the cadences of Mississippi. His manner is courtly, and he is sturdily built, with powerful arms and hands. He looks much younger than his 84 years, and he often cracks up when he tells his story.<br><br>He had always intended to return to Minnesota after his service, but he met his wife, Georgette, in San Francisco.  “There were two ladies in the waiting room at the dental clinic at Letterman, and I overheard them discussing issues with their daughters. I went up and said, ‘Tell you what, you give me your daughters’ phone numbers and I’ll take them out and tell you what’s up with them!’ One lady sniffed, ‘NO WAY!’ but the other lady gave me Georgette’s number.”<br><br>They met in February 1965, and were married that May. Though they divorced in 1980, they remain good friends and have three children, now in their 50s, seven grandchildren and two great-grandkids. His second marriage, to Cora, born in Mississippi like himself, “and the world’s greatest cook,” lasted until her death in 2008.  <br><br>Coming out of the army, he recalls, “I rented a two-bedroom on Golden Gate and Steiner for $135 a month, and got a job right away” at $75 a week at Pacific West Lab, in the building where he works today. “I told the owner I would only work there till the snow melts in Minnesota.”<br><br>Moody smiles, “I tell people the snow never melted, so I stayed in San Francisco.” <br><br>Pacific West Lab was busy. A hundred dental technicians worked there. Hawaii had no lab back then, so they also serviced all the dentists in Hawaii.<br><br>“Every Monday, three gigantic mailbags arrived from Hawaii, filled with dentures that needed fixing.”<br><br>Except for a few years at a lab in Oakland, Moody has worked at 450 Sutter his whole career. <br><br>And now, the third great stroke of luck: A friendship that lasted 60 years and changed his life. Roman Braunfeld was a Polish Jew, a holocaust survivor. He weighed 60 pounds, had TB, and was almost dead when the U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald, where he was a prisoner. One of the American soldiers who rescued him was a Black sergeant, also named Chester. <br><br>Braunfeld recovered in Switzerland, learned the dental technology trade, married, and emigrated to the United States in 1953.<br><br>Moody and Braunfeld had an instant rapport, a deep and abiding mutual respect. They worked together until their lab was bought out. Braunfeld left and started his own lab, Far West Dental, in 1970, on another floor; Moody followed shortly.<br><br>In addition to a thriving business, Braunfeld did pro bono work for those who couldn’t afford it, including recovering addicts at Delancey Street who had lost teeth to drugs.<br><br>They worked together until Braunfeld’s death in 2016. In 2006, Braunfeld sold the lab to Moody and his coworker, Lily Louie, age 65. Today, the pair work full time and employ four to five people, but it’s increasingly hard to find skilled craftspeople. The City College program from which Lily Louie graduated 40 years ago has closed. Much of the work is sent to China and other overseas labs, according to Moody.<br><br>Moody ‘s small studio is a throwback to an earlier time.<br><br>To get business, he goes around the building and visits patients in their dentists’ chairs. “I see 12 to 14 patients a day: I match tooth color, I design partials, and sometimes their dentures aren’t fitting right and the dentist will say, ‘Well, what can we do here, Chet?’“<br><br>Moody takes great pride and pleasure in his work. He sees it as a public service and an art. He tells the story of a 19-year-old patient, born with a terrible cleft palate. Moody manufactured an upper denture that was flexible enough to fold up to squeeze through the tight opening of his mouth. <br><br>“I have incredible non-book knowledge that Dr. Austin taught me,” he says. “For instance, take your two front teeth. I was taught that from the top of your head to the bottom of your chin, the length of the front teeth should be one-sixteenth of that measurement. Back in the ’60s, you could get dentists to give you that measurement for a patient, but they don’t do that anymore.”<br><br>When asked about retirement, he gestures around the busy lab. The place hums and buzzes with the sounds of grinding and polishing. “I am having too much fun to quit.” <br><br>On his break-room table are boxes of assorted chocolates and gourmet cookies, various sweets, all with thank you cards from grateful clients and dentists. “Help yourself,” he tells a visitor, “more work for me.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/pulling-his-own-tooth-with-a-pair-of-pliers-started-a-career-jim-crow-south-dental/

Around it, a flow of pedestrians and bicycles stream through the intersection, hardly noticing the felled former silk oak.<br><br>But the stump is new; it’s the remnant of a silk oak — which, despite its name, is not an oak at all but part of a completely different family of trees — that city crews cut down on March 16. Its exact age and height were not recorded by the city, but it was at least 30 years old and 50 feet tall, according to an estimate by Allegra Mautner, a Public Works urban forestry inspector who has kept an eye on the tree. <br><br>“It was kind of sad,” said Cassandra, who works at the nearby Fellow Barber. “It was just here one day, and then it was gone the next.”<br><br>The tree’s death sentence was issued only after multiple discussions, “because it’s such a high-profile tree, and it’s so important to a lot of members of the community,” said Mautner. Earlier, she discussed the issue with multiple supervisors at San Francisco Public Works before defining the tree a hazard that needed to be removed. <br><br>“It’s a very respectful tree,” said Mautner, who’s now going through a process of coming to terms with the decision. “Every time I biked past that tree after I made that decision, I always felt like, ‘Am I making the right decision?’”<br><br>The coup de grâce for the silk oak came in February during a series of windstorms. It dropped several large limbs, and that was that. <br><br>In addition, the tree’s excessive size had rendered its surrounding sidewalk a tripping hazard, impassable for people with disabilities. This constricted foot traffic and activities at a busy intersection, according to Mautner, one of San Francisco’s five urban forestry inspectors who collectively oversee the city’s roughly 125,000 street trees.<br><br>“This tree is very close to me,” she said. She has lived about a block from the silk oak since 2012, and she bikes past it every day on her commute. She took a longer look at the tree during the pandemic, when she did a lot of walking. She noticed the tree because it was a species she had never seen before. <br><br>But that was also one of the factors necessitating its removal. “It had very poor structure, which is common for this species,” Mautner said. Plus, because of frequent failures of small limbs, the tree’s crown had grown much smaller over the past several years. Its roots also topped the sidewalk, and became more unstable after the recent storms washed out some of the soil underneath. <br><br>“We really do try to maintain large trees in the urban environment, because they add so many benefits. but we also have to balance the risk that they pose to the public,” Mautner said. Throughout the years, the urban forestry team had added some asphalt patches to temporarily fix the area around the oak. These had degraded over time. City officials also considered a longer term-fix of doing more sidewalk work, but that was deemed infeasible because of the tree’s massive root structure.<br><br>Its size also prevented it from being transplanted. And even if moving the tree were an option, its deteriorating health made the odds of it surviving a transplant low.<br><br>Mautner conducted a final assessment in February, and deemed the silk oak a hazard. “I’m such a tree hugger. Then I have people who tell me that I’m such a tree hater, and I want to remove all the trees in San Francisco,” said the 34-year-old University of California, Berkeley, forestry major. <br><br>Between Feb. 12 to 27, tree removal notifications were posted on its trunk, on the street light posts around it, and on the Public Works website. With an annual tree mortality rate of four percent in San Francisco, Mautner posts new removal notices almost every week to let the community know in advance that a tree is leaving. <br><br>No one protested. <br><br>Mautner took some selfies with the silk oak when she knew it would soon be gone. On March 15, an arborist removed the tree. Soon, the whole site will be paved over. <br><br>A few days ago, Mautner passed an indigenous ceremony in front of City College’s Mission campus on her way home. She knew it wasn’t related. But it struck a chord with her. <br><br>She took comfort in knowing that “the tree had seen so many activities like this, so many marches came by and it lived a good, long life. We were able to keep this tree for a long period of time.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/the-50-foot-oak-that-towered-over-valencia-and-18th-for-at-least-30-years-is-now-a-stump/
9e4d8406-8f4f-4b51-b1e6-38aab488812e,news,mission,COMMUNITY,BETH WINEGARNER,"MARCH 22, 2024, 6:00 AM",Mission Dolores curator aims to humanize site’s indigenous dead,,"For more than 30 years, Mission Dolores curator Andrew Galvan has been on a quest: To memorialize more than 5,000 indigenous people buried in the mission’s cemetery, some of whom are Galvan’s own ancestors. <br><br>Galvan, a former archaeological consultant, remembers visiting Monsignor John O’Connor at Mission Dolores, the basilica’s pastor from 1983 to 1999, in the early 1990s, when the historic site was getting ready for a post-Loma Prieta seismic retrofit.<br><br>“We were having afternoon tea. He brought out the burial register and baptismal records, and we found my ancestors,” he said. <br><br>Galvan’s ancestor, Liberato Culpecse, was baptized in 1801 at Mission Dolores, but later moved to Mission San Jose. Culpecse’s parents, Jobocme and Poylemja, are buried in the mission’s cemetery, along with 5,700 other indigenous people, in unmarked graves. After seeing their names in these 200-year-old books, Galvan started thinking about ways to make all those ancestors more visible. <br><br>“I’ve collected the names of the Indians who were here during the Mission period,” Galvan said one afternoon in January, sitting in the pews of the old mission church. “Originally, I thought I could add an adobe wall and create plaques with all of the names. But even in 1992, it would have cost $1 million.”<br><br>Today, Galvan hopes to build a new, bigger museum on the Mission Dolores property that would include space for a plaque bearing the 5,700 names. The mission already has a small, one-room museum, but this one would extend into the adjacent playground for Mission Dolores Academy — which is part of the mission property, and was built over part of the mission’s cemetery. But the price tag has gone up: Galvan estimates the museum would cost $3 million to $4 million to build, and has only received donations covering a fraction of that amount. <br><br>As he pursues his quest, Galvan said he’ll need to reach out to local tribal groups to get their input. <br><br>“It would be a wonderful way for us to bring it into conversation, their actual names,” said Corinna Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in Oakland, the only local tribal group to respond to Mission Local’s requests for comment. “Giving them names helps to humanize them, which has been difficult for a long time in the Bay Area.”<br><br>Indigenous people have lived on the San Francisco peninsula for more than 13,000 years. In San Francisco, the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in several villages, including one near the present-day mission site, called Chutchui, on the banks of a waterway they named Ehwate. When Franciscan monks, under the guidance of Junipero Serra, arrived in 1776, they decided that Chutchui was the perfect site to build a mission. <br><br>The Franciscans forced indigenous residents into labor. The mission church and other structures, including barns and barracks, were constructed by indigenous hands; not just Ohlone, but also Pomo, Miwok, Patwin and Wappo people from the wider Bay Area. <br><br>Missionaries baptized the indigenous people who lived and worked at the mission, stripping them of their given names and rebranding them with Spanish ones. The hard work, near-starvation rations and waves of infectious illness killed thousands of indigenous people at the site. Galvan wants their names — their indigenous names — to be known again. <br><br>Facing the steep cost of creating a memorial in the ‘90s, Mission leaders put Galvan’s memorial plaque idea on the back burner. O’Connor moved to another post in 1997, and it wasn’t until Galvan was hired as the mission’s curator in 2004 that he picked up the idea again. He wrote a number of proposals and grant requests, including one to the California Missions Foundation for what he called an “Indian memorial” at Mission Dolores. <br><br>“The response I got from the committee was, “What about the names of the Spanish and Irish people buried there?’” Galvan recalled. “I said, ‘It says Indian memorial.’” The grant wasn’t approved. <br><br>In 2009, the mission hired Galvan’s cousin, Vincent Medina (who’s now co-founder of Cafe Ohlone in Berkeley) as assistant curator, and the cousins took matters into their own hands. They bought a pair of redwood boards from Home Depot and carved the names of Jobocme and Poylemja — who are Medina’s ancestors, too — into the wood. They now stand in the mission cemetery. <br><br>“The grave marker in the center of the cemetery is a tangible piece that visitors, community members, and family members can visit that gives proof to specific Native people buried at Mission Dolores. It gives recognition to two of the individuals that are interred there, and even without much label copy tells a story that is necessary to tell,” Galvan and Medina wrote in an academic article published in 2018. <br><br>In that article, they proposed projecting the indigenous dead’s names onto a wall at Mission Dolores. That, too, proved difficult and expensive: None of the mission’s current spaces are quite dark enough, and the projector would burn through about $150 a month in lightbulbs. <br><br>In any case, “I want something permanent, and having it adjacent to the graves makes the most sense,” Galvan said. In 2022, he assisted in creating a similar monument at the Franciscan mission in Sonoma, which reads, “In this sacred grounds lie buried men, women and children of the local Coast Miwok, Patwin, Wappo and Pomo tribes. They built, labored and died at Mission San Francisco Solano.” The site includes a stone etched with the names of 896 indigenous people buried there. <br><br>Burying people in the ground and marking them with individual stones isn’t the traditional way local indigenous people honor their ancestors, though many do it that way today, said Gould, the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust co-founder. Historically, most buried their dead in large shellmounds that were built up with seashells, earth and other materials, and located them within their villages, so the living wouldn’t be separated from them, she said.<br><br>Sogorea Te’ works in the East Bay to reclaim local land and steward it in indigenous ways. Recently, the nonprofit opened ‘Ookwe Park through an adopt-a-park program in Richmond, where tribes will grow and harvest medicinal plants, including yerba buena, mugwort, wild strawberries and soaproot. The site once held a shellmound, which was destroyed in the construction of the Officer Bradley Moody Memorial Underpass, Gould said.<br><br>It also purchased the embattled West Berkeley Shellmound site in March, formerly the location of a village and massive shellmound that covered many city blocks, all the way to the waterfront. The group plans to unearth Strawberry Creek, currently streaming underground, and build a new, poppy-covered shellmound that visitors can climb. <br><br>“We can show the magnitude of what a shellmound was. People can stand up high and see, similar to what my ancestors would have seen,” Gould said. The site will represent “not just the past and the horrific things that happened, but the resilience.” <br><br>Although Gould thinks Galvan is on the right track, she called the Mission Dolores memorial “a first step.” The Catholic Church extensively harmed the indigenous people of California, and owes them “some kind of reciprocity,” or even giving Chutchui land back to the Ramaytush Ohlone, she said. <br><br>Jonathan Cordero, founder and executive director of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, said the organization is working on some land-back initiatives in San Francisco, but none involving the Mission Dolores area. He declined to comment on the memorial plan.<br><br>For now, it’s unclear whether Mission Dolores will be able to raise enough money to bring its indigenous dead back into the light. Donations of any amount are welcome, Galvan said. <br><br>Disclosure: Beth Winegarner donates a small amount of money each year to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust and the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mission-dolores-curator-aims-to-humanize-sites-indigenous-dead/

San Francisco jail records reveal that Ellicott, 38, was booked at 9:07 this morning and is being held on $50,000 bail for his 62 felony charges.<br><br>He is accused of establishing a bogus company and using it to loot the very branch of the HR department that he was charged with keeping both technically and monetarily sound. <br><br>“The charges announced today reflect my office’s continuing commitment to uncover official misconduct in San Francisco’s City government,” District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement.  “My office would like to thank the Department of Human Resources for its swift and thorough cooperation in uncovering the depths of their trusted manager’s great betrayal.” <br><br>The January and March cases against Ellicott are unrelated, but it was the investigation into the former that led to today’s arrest and charging. In addition to allegedly selling high-end consumer electronics bought with emergency supply money, Ellicott was charged in January with participating in a larger municipal theft and kickback scheme operated by former Community Challenge Grant director Lanita Henriquez and former Gavin Newsom mayoral staffer, businessman and city fixer Dwayne Jones. <br><br>The District Attorney alleges that Jones’ company, RDJ Enterprises, paid Ellicott — a city employee at that time — nearly $270,000 over the course of four years. Ellicott then purportedly used Venmo and PayPal to funnel some $65,650 of Jones’ money to Henriquez. <br><br>In an affidavit released today, DA investigator Mike Reilly reveals that scrutiny of Ellicott’s financial transactions regarding the earlier case unearthed a “long series of unusual deposits” into his personal bank account totaling more than $450,000. These payments emanated from a source the DA refers to only as “Witness 1,” a Chicagoan. <br><br>Reilly reached “Witness 1,” who told him her old college pal Ellicott paid her $1,000 in 2019 to establish a company called IAG Services, and to set up a bank account for IAG services using her own name and information. She said Ellicott then took over the account. <br><br>Department of Human Resources managers confirmed to Reilly that Ellicott himself added IAG Services as a vendor into the city system in May 2019. Starting that month and continuing until January 2024 — the month of his prior arrest — more than $627,000 in payments were made from the city to IAG. These “appeared to be fraudulent payments related to otherwise legitimate workers’ compensation benefits.”<br><br>While these payments were ostensibly for “auditing services,” human resources managers told Reilly that no paperwork exists to indicate that any auditing services were actually performed. Ellicott’s former colleagues were unable to locate invoices for most of the payments to IAG, and those they did locate were all approved by Ellicott himself. <br><br>All told, the human resources department provided the DA with 643 workers’ comp claims billed to IAG. Most were billed just once, with a payment between $925 and $986. Between 2019 and January 2024, the total amount paid was $627,118.86. Email records indicate Ellicott either approved these payments himself, or asked colleagues to process them. <br><br>The DA investigator traced more than $450,400 in payments from IAG to Ellicott’s personal bank account over the course of four years. These semi-monthly payments were denoted “Direct Deposit [Witness 1] D BILL PMT BILL PMT.” It was this series of regular payments that first caught investigator Reilly’s eye.<br><br>Following Henriquez’s arrest in August 2023, these payments were purportedly redirected to a different account tied to Ellicott. All told, the DA claims more than $488,000 was transferred between IAG and multiple Ellicott accounts. <br><br>Ellicott began working for the city in 2012, with a brief hiatus between 2015 and 2016. He was a manager at the human resources department from 2017 until January 25 of this year, when he was placed on paid leave.<br><br>Transparent California lists Ellicott’s 2022 pay as $187,884, with benefits of $55,613, for a total compensation package of $243,496. His most recent position with the human resources department was “assistant director of finance and technology.” The human resources department describes his position as being “responsible for the financial integrity of the Workers’ Compensation Division” — the division he oversaw and allegedly looted.<br><br>The Department of Human Resources announced today that it has implemented new controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.<br><br>Ellicott’s 62 charges include grand theft, misappropriation of public money, insurance fraud and money laundering.

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/
345393b9-1ab4-479a-9726-c97e147b3d75,news,richmond,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
a5a989c3-370a-4ad8-8114-0bfac03b7d4b,news,richmond,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors.

First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/
ecd75823-f12c-4d8f-8f28-ec3dca1f00cc,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!<br><br>I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.<br><br>You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.<br><br>Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.<br><br>Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.<br><br>Vince Yuen

5d816f1a-dfae-49d3-acec-9b584de222d2,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Press Release: Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Milestone,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Another Milestone<br><br>The City and Alexandria Theater Developer Sign Initial Agreement<br><br>Today, Supervisor Connie Chan announced the initial agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was signed jointly by TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC and the Office of Workforce and Economic Development. Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
18d66b34-6509-49c6-8b29-c9492de8de41,news,sunset,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

District 2 Supervisor Catherine Stefani recused herself from representation because her husband owns a boat in the marina. The grassroots group “Keep The Waterfront Open” collected more than 2,500 signatures opposing plans that would remove boats located at Gashouse Cove — part of the Marina Small Craft Harbor since the 1960s — so that PG&E can “decontaminate the water.” Along with removal of the wooden slips and the only public fuel dock in town, the view of bobbing masts would be gone forever.<br><br>Critics say the plan is really about the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department’s desire to accommodate much larger yachts, which would further restrict views from the Marina Green but would increase revenue flow to the agency, all while allowing PG&E to save millions by doing a less than adequate cleanup of its toxins under the water of the adjacent Gashouse Cove.<br><br>With Stefani abstaining, the city charter says “the privilege of the floor shall not be granted, for any purpose, to persons other than officers of the City or their duly authorized representatives. This rule shall not be suspended except by unanimous consent of all Supervisors present,” which leaves residents without representation from their elected supervisor.<br><br>At an Oct. 19 meeting, Rec and Park voted to move forward with an environmental impact review for the proposed plan, despite local opposition.",https://www.marinatimes.com/controversial-harbor-threatens-marina-green-view

Add to that the challenge of high rents; hiring; crime; and the pandemic, which forced the closure of many businesses, owning or opening a small business in the city is challenging. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20 percent of new businesses fail, and some reports are that it is higher in San Francisco.<br><br>There may be hope: Earlier this year, Mayor London Breed proposed legislation to improve the permitting process with more than 100 changes to the current Planning Code. Among the proposed changes are allowing more business uses on ground floors to help fill commercial vacancies; lifting restrictions on restaurants and bars in certain neighborhoods — including Union Street; easing the legalization process for existing outdoor patios; and enabling nighttime entertainment, bars, and restaurants to benefit from priority permit processing.<br><br>The legislation is in part designed to provide small businesses the ability to adapt to a “flexible retail” model, which currently is allowed only in certain districts, and would accommodate changing circumstances, such as the pandemic and consumer behavior. That model would allow previously existing business to change to a different use without having to reapply to the city for new permits for each change.<br><br>The Planning Commission will consider these changes in a public meeting on Sept 7.",https://www.marinatimes.com/jump-starting-businesses-in-our-neighborhoods

He highlighted the correlation between burn injuries and poverty, and introduced the challenges India faced in burn management.<br><br>Dr. Folke Sjoberg, president of the International Society for Burn Injuries provided an overview of the society, its evolution, and its diverse and multidisciplinary teams. He also highlighted the advancements in global burn care.<br><br>Dr. Ariel Miranda, secretary of the ISBI and a plastic surgeon and chief of the pediatric burn unit in Guadalajara, Mexico discussed the organization’s objectives, including collaboration with NGOs and prioritized inclusion of low-income nations as members.

Calvin Harris is at the bottom of the line-up and is referred to as “Returning to the Desert,” implying that he has yet to be assigned a specific performance date. <br><br>The festival is taking place over the weekends of April 14th-16th and April 21st-23rd, and will be the first Coachella not to land on Easter Sunday, which is on April 9th this year. <br><br>Friday’s roster consists of some beloved acts such as Gorillaz, The Chemical Brothers and Blondie, as well as Latin singer Becky G and Nigerian superstar Burna Boy. Rosalía, Charlie XCX, Labrinth, boygenius and Underworld are playing on Saturday, and Sunday will conclude with Björk, Kali Uchis, Porter Robinson, Dominic Fike and Jai Paul, among others. Metro Boomin, Pusha T, Rae Sremmurd and Yung Lean are some of the rap artists that will be performing throughout the weekend. <br><br>Frank Ocean is still on the bill, which is remarkable considering that he was initially planned to perform at the 2020 festival, which was canceled due to the pandemic, and was then expected to appear at the 2022 return, but was ultimately left out. Coachella made an uncharacteristic early announcement of his return for 2023. Frank Ocean has a history of cancelling festival appearances, including the 2015 FYF Fest in Los Angeles, which was filled in by Kanye West. He returned for the 2017 FYF Fest and gave a show-stopping performance with the help of Brad Pitt. <br><br>The other headliners demonstrate the increasing worldwide sound that Coachella is incorporating, with Latin superstar Bad Bunny leading the way and BLACKPINK being the first K-pop group to headline the festival. BLACKPINK made their Coachella debut in 2019 as the first all-female K-pop act, and their headline status this year is a testament to the rising popularity of K-pop.<br><br>Click here for the complete line-up.<br><br>",https://www.marinatimes.com/coachella-2023-line-up-announced

SFMTA’s plan was released on March 14 as part of the five-year pilot program allowed by the passage of Assembly Bill 645. Six cities, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, will use automated speed cameras to capture images of rear license plates of vehicles that go over the speed limit to penalize motorists in a bid to improve safety.<br><br>“We are anticipating that speed safety cameras are an important part of an overall what can be done on a street but not the only thing,” Hake said. “We believe that they're going to be most effective with engineering changes as well that change the roadway layout or change how fast you can drive on a street.”<br><br>San Francisco will be allotted 33 cameras to be placed around the city. The number is determined by the city’s population. The SFMTA plans to place the cameras in corridors on the high-injury networks, streets where collisions happen the most frequently.

Dorsey was the main sponsor of the resolution.<br><br>“With the San Francisco Board of Supervisors’ passage of this resolution today, we’re expanding on our city’s commitment to its diverse communities by supporting the diverse community-based journalism that’s part of it,” Dorsey added.<br><br>The report titled “Local Voices on Local News: Community Perspectives and Policy Recommendations for Strengthening San Francisco’s Journalism Ecosystem” released in February looked at the community and ethnic journalism community landscape and held focus groups in different languages (English, Chinese Spanish and Tagalog) for several months with San Franciso residents to find what their needs are in reading local news.<br><br>“Local news is critical to our democracy, and we know that San Franciscans are hungry for more,” said Maya Chupkov, media and democracy program manager at California Common Cause in a news release.<br><br>One of the recommendations in the report was the idea of city departments shifting some of the advertising money they spend to independent media publishers that would help provide resources for community and ethnic media news outlets to stay afloat.<br><br>The report said community journalism news media outlets play a critical role in the media landscape as they report and cover news stories in the community and neighborhoods that are not necessarily the main focus of major news outlets in San Francisco.<br><br>“This investment in local media has proven successful in New York and Chicago, and will likewise ensure that our city government supports and communicates directly and effectively with readers of underserved ethnic and community media,” said Michael Yamashita in a news release, who is the publisher of the Bay Area Reporter newspaper.<br><br>At the request of Dorsey, the Budget and Legislative Analyst released a report last December to provide options for creating a program to direct more advertising spending to these types of outlets. The BLA report said 98 media outlets were operating in the city, but only seven publications were approved by the Board of Supervisors for an advertising contract to publish legally required notices for fiscal year 2023-24.<br><br>The BLA report looked at other cities that have programs where advertising and outreach expenditures go to community news outlets. Cities, namely New York, have codified into law that at least 50% of all print and digital advertising — excluding legally required notices — be spent in community and ethnic media outlets. A list of media outlets was compiled and an office within the mayor’s office was created to monitor the program.<br><br>The BLA gave city officials policy considerations if they were to pursue such a program like New York, including a vetted directory of community and ethnic news outlets and setting a mandated percentage of advertising that would go towards these news outlets. Additionally, the BLA stated the city would need to clearly define what is considered advertising, establish a system to track how spending will be tracked and reported and determine which community and ethnic media outlets can qualify as a city vendor.<br><br>San Francisco State University Journalism Department Chair Jesse Garnier said there should also be other criteria established to prevent political interference if community and ethnic journalism outlets were to receive money from the city government. The journalism department is acting as a local independent monitor to help with the city’s plan to prioritize advertising dollars to ethnic media outlets and independent news publishers.<br><br>The Bay Area Independent Community Media Coalition, which is being led by California Common Cause and includes several community and bilingual publications in print and online in the city, is advocating for a policy solution that would increase the amount of advertising the city spends in local community and ethnic media outlets.

Parents and teachers, fearing the district was phasing out the K-8 model, immediately launched an advocacy effort, with around 100 of them showing up at two school district meetings to make impassioned pleas.  <br><br>Just as they were anxiously anticipating the worst news on March 22, when school budgets were due, they instead discovered that three of the four K-8s they advocated for dodged some or all of the proposed cuts.<br><br>San Francisco Community School, a K-8 in the Excelsior, was going to lose its only middle-school physical education teacher and a campus security position for the coming school year. Days after advocates participated in their second school district meeting on March 13, the district let them know that both positions would come back, according to Maia Piccagli, president of the school’s Parent Action Council.<br><br>She wasn’t quite sure exactly why, but thought it had something to do with their advocacy. “I felt amazing, I felt really excited. Honestly, I’ve done a lot of advocacy in my life, but I have rarely seen an immediate change,” she said. “It felt great to have had so many parents involved in making statements and having there be such a quick win afterwards.”<br><br>“We are happy to hear that SFUSD leadership is receiving and applying feedback,” said Frank Lara, executive vice president of United Educators of San Francisco, in a statement.<br><br>The school district, while emphasizing it is “committed to a transparent process for school staffing and budget allocation,” did not specify how the decision had been made.<br><br>SoMa’s Bessie Carmichael School PreK-8 Filipino Education Center also got what its parents and teachers advocated for: The reinstatement of one of the school’s two social workers, who the school district was going to cut. The good news came last Thursday morning — less than two days after the school board meeting, according to the school community. <br><br>Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School’s parents and teachers advocated for seven teaching positions the district had put on the block.  <br><br>The community learned early last week that the school district would reinstate two of their campus security positions, according to principal Claudia Delarios-Moran, who remains uncertain of the reason. These are necessary positions for the school, parents and teachers said, which the school had planned to hire at its own expense in the coming school year.<br><br>While the school district declined to add back the seven teaching positions, the money Buena Vista Horace Man will be able to save from spending on two campus security positions will be used to hire an extra teacher, reducing the casualties from seven to six. The school plans to hire a teacher to help with its fourth and fifth grades with the $157,000 saved, according to Delarios-Moran.<br><br>“I feel relieved, because it allows us to cut one less position,” said Delarios-Moran. “It gets us closer to where we were before in the first place.”<br><br>Twin Peaks’ Rooftop School TK-8 was not as fortunate. The school district informed the school in early March that it would lose one of its kindergarten positions. The school community made comments at the March 4 district advisory meeting, but didn’t show up at the following week’s school board meeting.<br><br>The position was not reinstated.<br><br>“They did not give us our kindergarten class back,” Rooftop Principal Darren Kawaii said last Friday. Kawaii also said he did not know how such decisions were made. <br><br>They might “get it back” the year after, he said, “but it’s not confirmed.” <br><br>Parents and teachers want assurances that “we will definitely get our kindergarten [teacher] back next year,” Kawaii added, but the district “won’t put it in writing whether it’s happening or not.”<br><br>The school district will start discussing school consolidation and closures this Thursday at a virtual town hall.

The 20-year-old is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl earlier this month while he was employed as an after-school worker at Everett Middle School.<br><br>San Francisco Superior Court Judge Brian L. Ferrall also determined that the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>Reyes, a worker with the nonprofit Mission Graduates’ after-school program, was arrested on March 5 at Everett Middle School following alleged improper contact with a student. He has been in custody since the arrest. <br><br>On March 11, Reyes pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment. His maximum time in prison would be 14 years for the charges, which include three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, unlawful sexual intercourse and contact with a minor for sexual offense, according to court documents. <br><br>A preliminary hearing was held today in Department 13 on the second floor of the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. Only Reyes’ mother and two other family members were in the courtroom’s audience. <br><br>Reyes showed up in an orange jumpsuit and smiled when saw his family members. Throughout the two-hour hearing, Reyes repeatedly looked back to exchange glances with his family, especially his mother. At one point, Reyes mouthed “Love you” to his mother, who nodded in response. <br><br>Deputy public defender Semuteh Freeman, who represents Reyes, said her client was comfortable participating in the hearing in English until a Spanish interpreter was available, saying that Reyes attended school and was educated in English from the age of 13. Two interpreters arrived in the second hour of the hearing and began interpreting the proceedings for Reyes.<br><br>Prosecutor Tanisha Gooch summoned two witnesses today: A San Francisco police officer and a sergeant, who both had first-hand information regarding the case. <br><br>Officer Bryan Santan responded with his partner to the initial call at 12:45 p.m. on March 5 . He spoke with both Principal Alicia Blacknell and the alleged victim in the principal’s office at Everett Middle School. <br><br>Santana said the victim and Reyes had known each other for several months before the alleged rape. They had kissed several times prior to March 5, but had not had a prior sexual relationship. While Santana continued to describe details of the alleged rape, Reyes shook his head. <br><br>The purported victim took the bus to 16th and Mission streets, and then walked to meet Reyes at his nearby apartment, where the alleged rape took place, according to what Santana learned. The victim went to school after leaving Reyes’ apartment. Later, she felt physical pain and messaged Reyes. <br><br>While being interviewed by Officer Santana on March 5, Blacknell identified Reyes as the “boyfriend” the victim had mentioned to her. Santana also identified Reyes in the courtroom today.<br><br>On March 5, the alleged victim told Santana, a certified Spanish translator, that her communication with Reyes was in Spanish. Santana saw several screenshots of the victim’s text messages, in Spanish, with Reyes. He told the court that the principal showed him the screenshots, and he saw them again later after obtaining the alleged victim’s phone. <br><br>Both public defender Freeman and officer Santana agreed today that the resolution of the screenshots presented as exhibits in court today was so low that they were not legible. Still, Santana described what he could remember of the text messages.<br><br>He saw messages, including heart-shaped emojis, in Instagram DMs. He also recalled seeing the background photo of the alleged victim and Reyes’ WhatsApp exchange, which he said both sides could see: “The photo behind the entire series of texts that I was shown appeared to be the victim in a bra, wearing a small pair of jean shorts, looking away from the camera,” Santana said.<br><br>He also recalled the 12-year-old and Reyes calling each other pet names, saying “I love you,” and sending emojis of heart shapes and kisses. Once, Reyes even sent a Spanish sentence that could be roughly translated as “I wanna eat you up,” according to Santana.<br><br>But not every communique between the alleged victim and Reyes was so light. When the 12-year-old informed Reyes of being in pain after sexual intercourse, court documents list his responses as, “I’m sorry for being so hard” and “It only hurts the first time.” <br><br>Santana acknowledged that neither he nor his partner turned their body camera on when they interviewed the 12-year-old on March 5, because of the police department’s policy on such cameras.<br><br>The second witness, Sergeant Daniel Kelly, was assigned the case on March 5, and spoke to the alleged victim about Reyes that evening. According to Kelly, she first met Reyes in late 2023, months before Reyes started working in the after-school program at Everett. When the alleged rape occurred on March 5, the victim was aware that Reyes was working at Everett, and that day was her first visit to Reyes’ apartment.<br><br>Kelly said the 12-year-old named three platforms on which she and Reyes had been communicating: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The girl’s phone has been turned over to the Crime Scene Investigation’s multimedia evidence unit.<br><br>Kelly also interviewed Reyes at Mission Station on March 5 and described Reyes as “calm.” Reyes said he taught art and coached sixth, seventh and eighth grade soccer at Everett. Reyes, who has a young child of his own, said he believed the victim was approximately 16 years old. He also said they were in love with each other; “that nobody has ever made him feel the way Jane Doe has,” said Kelly.  <br><br>He said “other female students [at Everett] had been essentially throwing themselves at him in a romantic sense, trying to give him hugs, trying to locate him on social media, messaging him [so much] that he had to regularly rebuff them,” said Kelly, recounting a conversation with Reyes.<br><br>Reyes acknowledged that he knew the victim was too young to have a sexual relationship with him, Kelly testified.<br><br>Kelly has had difficulty locating the address of the apartment where the alleged rape took place. According to the sergeant, Reyes provided one address, while Kelly and his team found another. <br><br>The victim received medical care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. <br><br>Reyes has been held in jail without bail. “The Defendant is an employee at a middle school, and thus surrounded by potential future victims,” the District Attorney’s Office argued in court documents. <br><br>Attorneys of both parties and Judge Ferrall discussed whether Reyes should be moved to home detention, which Ferrall later dismissed, citing a public-safety risk.<br><br>Public defender Freeman said that, while Reyes did have a prior misdemeanor conviction in Richmond when he was 18, he has no other criminal record. Freeman said he has been shuttled in and out of foster care facilities since he was 13. Once Reyes was incarcerated, he lost the funds to pay rent for his apartment.<br><br>“I’m asking the court to consider the effect of prolonged incarceration on him. I do think that there are other non-carceral ways that the court can ensure public safety,” said Freeman. “I don’t think he’s a flight risk, both because we have a default here, but also because he has a child and mother, and he is co-parenting his child.”<br><br>Freeman also noted that the Central American Resource Center of Northern California has been working with Reyes and his mother on asylum claims.<br><br>“The people are concerned about public safety,” prosecutor Gooch argued. “He’s making comments that the young girls at this middle school who are in grades six through eight, are throwing themselves at him. He acknowledged during his interview that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that the victim was too young, but he did it anyway, because that’s how love works.”<br><br>“I agree he’s not a flight risk, but the risk to public safety, from the evidence I’ve heard, is severe,” said Ferrall, who said the material presented today in court was “extremely troubling.” <br><br>“I can’t say that I’m comfortable with a less restrictive alternative of home detention, given what’s happened, and none of which would have been prevented by him being on electronic monitoring in his apartment,” he added, adding that the fact that the alleged rape happened at Reyes’ home rendered home detention a risk.<br><br>The judge also mentioned that Reyes has inflicted a potentially lifetime impact on the alleged victim. He also found Reyes’ comments of other girls at Everett throwing themselves at him troubling.<br><br>Ferrall discharged the felony charge of sodomy of a person under 18 for lack of evidence. Five felony charges remain.<br><br>After the decisions were made, Reyes broke into tears, lowering his head while his shoulders shook uncontrollably. Reyes’ mother, whose eyes were red from a morning of crying, called out words of encouragement to Reyes in Spanish. <br><br>Ferrall also determined that he had seen enough evidence for Reyes to be held to answer, and the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>The court has prohibited Reyes from coming within 150 yards of the victim or having electronic, written or telephonic contact with the victim, or contacting the victim through a third party other than the attorney.  ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/everett-after-school-worker-accused-of-rape-remains-incarcerated-troubling-material-emerges-in-court/

If so, you’re better informed than many of the folks working this year’s mayoral campaigns — or running in them — who tend to default to ‘a lot.’ <br><br>They’re not wrong, but the Department of Elections informs us that the exact answer is 10. Ten! Can you imagine it? Can you envision the thought process behind parsing your sixth, seventh and eighth choices? It’d be like asking Elizabeth Taylor to rank her ex-husbands (and Liz would complicate her ballot by putting Richard Burton twice). <br><br>Will most San Francisco voters dutifully fill out all 10 spots? Of course not; that’d be a lot to expect out of a voter, especially when, like the roster of a city Little League team, the talent level among the mayoral candidates really drops off after the top four or five. <br><br>So, no, most San Francisco voters will not emulate David Letterman and craft their own Top-10 lists. But the vast majority will be voting for multiple candidates, as the system allows. The national ranked-choice voting advocacy group Fair Vote crunched 20 years of San Francisco data, and noted that the median number of city voters who’ve been opting for multiple candidates is 74 percent. <br><br>That’s a lot of extra votes out there. Candidates neglecting, ignoring or disdaining the voting system we’ve had in place since 2004 are setting themselves up to be neglected, ignored or disdained. And yet, it happens more than you’d think. <br><br>With the dust settling from the March 5 election, we’re entering into a period of what one pithy city player calls “moderate-on-moderate violence.” <br><br>Up in the political heavens, our Masters of the Universe are turning on one another. Some of the billionaires will support the incumbent. But some won’t: Don’t look now, but Mark Farrell established a candidate-controlled committee last week to push the mayoral-strengthening ballot measures from Michael Moritz’s TogetherSF … which also enables Farrell to raise unlimited funds. <br><br>On a more terrestrial plane, the competition for mayoral endorsements will be fierce. And multifaceted. This is a multi-front war. It will be fought over the now moderate-heavy Democratic County Central Committee, the big-money groups spending with sailor-on-liberty ferocity over the last several election cycles, neighborhood and ethnic Democratic clubs, and influential and quasi-influential individuals. When it comes to bending the ears of individual DCCC member-elects, we’re told, “the wooing season has already started.” <br><br>Mayor London Breed’s team has, additionally, made it clear that it is not interested in any dual or ranked endorsements. This is a loaded decree coming from a sitting mayor who’ll be running this town for the next eight-odd months (and may yet win in November). It’d be nice if she picked up the phone for you, right? Political and governmental issues aren’t supposed to bleed into one another, but it often happens here on planet Earth.  <br><br>At this point, this is just a battle over endorsements. Breed’s demand that she and she alone be recognized makes political sense. It does not benefit her to have other people’s names and photos on the campaign brochures she’d rather have featuring her and her alone. That’s hardly unwise or crazy. <br><br>But there’s a difference between consolidating endorsements for a campaign and actually running a campaign. And, at this point, everything seems to point toward the mayor having little interest in engaging with the ranked-choice strategy that has governed San Francisco elections for a generation and will decide this one, whether she likes it or not. <br><br>Do you know what percentage of the time the candidate who wins the most first-place votes goes on to win in a ranked-choice election? According to the data sets over at Fair Vote, it’s around 94 percent. Didn’t Mayor Breed finish first in a 2018 election in which she put minimal effort into a ranked-choice strategy, and then hang on to beat Mark Leno and Jane Kim, who put a maximal effort into such a strategy? Yes, that happened. So what’s the big deal? <br><br>Let’s address the higher-end issue first. Many elections, if not most, are not particularly competitive. If we had a ranked-choice contest on what to have for dinner and the choices were pizza, haggis or Scandinavian aspic, the permutations of RCV would not likely come into play. <br><br>And that leads to the forthcoming San Francisco mayoral election — and how, in some ways, it’s 180 degrees different than the race Breed won in 2018. One thing it certainly isn’t is a pizza-haggis-aspic competition. It seems plain that this one is going to be competitive, and the notion of any of the declared candidates amassing a double-digit first-round lead, as Breed did in 2018, feels more than a bit fanciful. It certainly doesn’t feel like a solid assumption that our deeply unpopular incumbent mayor, who is running in the same ideological lane as two other well-financed competitors, is a lock to finish first at all. <br><br>In that 2018 contest, Leno and Kim each garnered about 60,000 first-place votes. That was a good 30,000 behind Breed — but, combined, the two outpolled her handily. Over the course of eight rounds of ranked-choice tabulations, Leno gained on Breed, eventually losing by just 2,500-odd votes, a 50.55 to 49.45 tilt. <br><br>In 2024, we won’t have two candidates neatly splitting the pie among voters less ideologically inclined to vote for Breed. Rather, now we’ll have multiple candidates on her side of the sandbox, splitting her voters. There is, clearly, a big center-left lane in which to run. Aaron Peskin is biding his time like Godot — And if he doesn’t come? We’ll come back tomorrow. And then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. But it figures he will eventually arrive. Perhaps as soon as April. <br><br>Peskin is in no hurry. Why interrupt this moderate-on-moderate violence? But when he does finally enter, a ranked-choice strategy among his mayoral competitors would seem to be de rigueur. But it remains to be seen if these candidates can get over individual ambitions and personal animosity to agree on anything. Election professionals worry that these sorts of deals, at least early in the election cycle, project weakness. They also give your chosen voter base tacit permission to vote for another candidate. <br><br>Election professionals, however, also know the value of (eventually) forming alliances. Candidates, though, often don’t; candidates can be the most inconvenient part of the electoral process for election professionals. So can voters, who are less ideological than political insiders and, messaging be damned, vote for candidate combinations that don’t make intuitive sense. One casualty of moderate-on-moderate violence may be punch-drunk voters. <br><br>“There should be genuine concern about confusing voters,” a moderate operative tells me. <br><br>Ranked-choice voting needn’t be confusing, but politics often is. In 2018, even up to the penultimate seventh round of ranked-choice tabulations, Kim and Leno held nearly 57 percent of the vote. The electorate, at that time, was clearly leaning progressive, so multiple progressives entered the fray, split the vote, diluted their collective leverage, and the mayoral contest was won by a moderate. It’s funny how that works. <br><br>This year, the electorate would seem to be leaning moderate. And, lo, multiple moderates have entered the fray. Moderates have the clear advantage — and, as a result of that, every individual candidate is incentivized to stay in the race, work for his or her own benefit, and dilute their collective leverage. It has the potential to work out funny again.<br><br>Regardless, it will be fascinating to see what comes next — if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/moderate-on-moderate-violence-sf-mayoral-races-next-act/
fbe21dfc-418f-4754-92f4-2841d516b6db,news,mission,PEOPLE WE MEET,NAOMI BETH MARCUS,"MARCH 24, 2024, 4:36 AM",Pulling his own tooth with a pair of pliers started Chester Moody’s career,,"Imagine having such a terrible toothache and no access to a dentist that you take a pair of pliers and pull your own tooth. Meet Chester Moody.<br><br>It’s 1958 in the Jim Crow South: Lorman, Mississippi, to be precise. He is 17 years old, attending Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college, and he is in excruciating pain. At the administration office, he is told it will be 21 days before a dentist visits the college, and Black students can’t leave campus.<br><br>So, young Chester Moody broke into the campus woodshop, borrowed a pair of pliers, and performed his own extraction.<br><br>“It took me a while to get the courage, but the moment I clamped the pliers around that molar, the pain went away,” recalls Moody, 84, from his dental lab on the 16th floor of the downtown Sutter Street Medical/Dental Building, where he fabricates dental prosthetics, including dentures, implants and more. “I now know that it was the gas escaping, but I couldn’t walk around with pliers coming out of my mouth. I was screwing up my courage to pull, and suddenly there was a snap and the top part of the tooth was gone! Oh, the smell was terrible, but the relief was instant.”<br><br>Born in 1939 in Coffeeville, Mississippi, Moody studied to be a teacher. “In those days in the South, there were two professions open to Black men: You could be a preacher or a teacher.”<br><br>He planned to teach industrial arts because, hey, he could sure wield those pliers. <br><br>Dentistry had never entered his mind. <br><br>Now, in life, there are all kinds of luck: Dumb luck and blind luck, bad luck and good luck and hard luck. In Chester Moody’s life, three lucky breaks changed his destiny. <br><br>The first: After graduating from Alcorn College in 1960, he went to St. Paul, Minnesota, to visit family. “Now, my aunt was taking my cousins to get their teeth cleaned, and she said, “You come too, Chester,” and we got there, to the Mayo Clinic, and this dentist did the exam after my cleaning and said, ‘Whoever extracted that back molar did a terrible job, he left the root tips in.’ I laughed and told him that was me.” <br><br>That dentist, Dr. Louie T. Austin, was the director of dental services at the Mayo Clinic, and “he fell in love with me for my story,” Moody recalls. “He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.”<br><br>Dr. Austin offered Moody a job in his lab, and taught him the trade. “This guy was the greatest teacher in the world. That’s where I got started, in the laboratory, and fell in love with it. “<br><br>Moody worked for Dr. Austin a few years, until he was drafted into the United States Army.<br><br>“I was going to defect to Canada, but my mom wept and wept, and so I said I wouldn’t go, and reluctantly stepped over the line.”<br><br>And here comes the second piece of luck. “I finished basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was scheduled to be sent to North Carolina to learn artillery. Three days before I was supposed to go, I get called into the orderly room where you get your orders.”<br><br>Even today, 60 years later, his face beams with delight as he quotes his commanding officer: “Private Moody, your orders have been changed. You are going to SAN FRANCISCO, to LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL. They need a dental technician.”  <br><br>He said he stopped listening after “San Francisco,” because he was so excited. He and a buddy had been planning a cross-country trip out here. “I called Jim immediately and I said, ‘Guess what? I am going to San Francisco, and my ticket is being paid by YOUR UNCLE!  Your UNCLE SAM!’”  <br><br>The staff dental technician at Letterman was being sent to Vietnam, and Moody was his replacement.<br><br>Moody arrived in San Francisco in February 1963. <br><br>He lived in barracks at the Presidio. “Imagine waking up every morning and out your window, YOUR WINDOW, you are looking at the prettiest sight you ever saw, the Golden Gate Bridge.”<br><br>On weekends, he and his buddies explored California. “We went north, we went all along the south coast, we went east. Oh, I was in the service, yes, but I was enjoying EVERY MINUTE OF IT!“<br><br>Even today, after 60 years in San Francisco, Moody’s speech is molasses-thick with the cadences of Mississippi. His manner is courtly, and he is sturdily built, with powerful arms and hands. He looks much younger than his 84 years, and he often cracks up when he tells his story.<br><br>He had always intended to return to Minnesota after his service, but he met his wife, Georgette, in San Francisco.  “There were two ladies in the waiting room at the dental clinic at Letterman, and I overheard them discussing issues with their daughters. I went up and said, ‘Tell you what, you give me your daughters’ phone numbers and I’ll take them out and tell you what’s up with them!’ One lady sniffed, ‘NO WAY!’ but the other lady gave me Georgette’s number.”<br><br>They met in February 1965, and were married that May. Though they divorced in 1980, they remain good friends and have three children, now in their 50s, seven grandchildren and two great-grandkids. His second marriage, to Cora, born in Mississippi like himself, “and the world’s greatest cook,” lasted until her death in 2008.  <br><br>Coming out of the army, he recalls, “I rented a two-bedroom on Golden Gate and Steiner for $135 a month, and got a job right away” at $75 a week at Pacific West Lab, in the building where he works today. “I told the owner I would only work there till the snow melts in Minnesota.”<br><br>Moody smiles, “I tell people the snow never melted, so I stayed in San Francisco.” <br><br>Pacific West Lab was busy. A hundred dental technicians worked there. Hawaii had no lab back then, so they also serviced all the dentists in Hawaii.<br><br>“Every Monday, three gigantic mailbags arrived from Hawaii, filled with dentures that needed fixing.”<br><br>Except for a few years at a lab in Oakland, Moody has worked at 450 Sutter his whole career. <br><br>And now, the third great stroke of luck: A friendship that lasted 60 years and changed his life. Roman Braunfeld was a Polish Jew, a holocaust survivor. He weighed 60 pounds, had TB, and was almost dead when the U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald, where he was a prisoner. One of the American soldiers who rescued him was a Black sergeant, also named Chester. <br><br>Braunfeld recovered in Switzerland, learned the dental technology trade, married, and emigrated to the United States in 1953.<br><br>Moody and Braunfeld had an instant rapport, a deep and abiding mutual respect. They worked together until their lab was bought out. Braunfeld left and started his own lab, Far West Dental, in 1970, on another floor; Moody followed shortly.<br><br>In addition to a thriving business, Braunfeld did pro bono work for those who couldn’t afford it, including recovering addicts at Delancey Street who had lost teeth to drugs.<br><br>They worked together until Braunfeld’s death in 2016. In 2006, Braunfeld sold the lab to Moody and his coworker, Lily Louie, age 65. Today, the pair work full time and employ four to five people, but it’s increasingly hard to find skilled craftspeople. The City College program from which Lily Louie graduated 40 years ago has closed. Much of the work is sent to China and other overseas labs, according to Moody.<br><br>Moody ‘s small studio is a throwback to an earlier time.<br><br>To get business, he goes around the building and visits patients in their dentists’ chairs. “I see 12 to 14 patients a day: I match tooth color, I design partials, and sometimes their dentures aren’t fitting right and the dentist will say, ‘Well, what can we do here, Chet?’“<br><br>Moody takes great pride and pleasure in his work. He sees it as a public service and an art. He tells the story of a 19-year-old patient, born with a terrible cleft palate. Moody manufactured an upper denture that was flexible enough to fold up to squeeze through the tight opening of his mouth. <br><br>“I have incredible non-book knowledge that Dr. Austin taught me,” he says. “For instance, take your two front teeth. I was taught that from the top of your head to the bottom of your chin, the length of the front teeth should be one-sixteenth of that measurement. Back in the ’60s, you could get dentists to give you that measurement for a patient, but they don’t do that anymore.”<br><br>When asked about retirement, he gestures around the busy lab. The place hums and buzzes with the sounds of grinding and polishing. “I am having too much fun to quit.” <br><br>On his break-room table are boxes of assorted chocolates and gourmet cookies, various sweets, all with thank you cards from grateful clients and dentists. “Help yourself,” he tells a visitor, “more work for me.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/pulling-his-own-tooth-with-a-pair-of-pliers-started-a-career-jim-crow-south-dental/
288e3ddf-1c39-43e9-88e3-46bbf9687283,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 23, 2024, 3:01 PM",Mark Farrell’s pitch to voters? ‘Common sense.’,,"Three times within an hour, San Francisco mayoral hopeful Mark Farrell called on voters to use “common sense” to decide on their stance on city issues. <br><br>“San Francisco is moving away from just being ideological, this left and right, progressive and moderate,” Farrell said last night, to a sold-out crowd at Manny’s cafe in conversation with Mission Local’s managing editor, Joe Eskenazi. “Let’s just have common sense again.”<br><br>Farrell, like Daniel Lurie and Ahsha Safaí in earlier conversations, expressed his frustration with the city’s status quo, and strived to differentiate himself from the rest of the field, stacked with candidates who will be making their appeals to the same set of moderate voters. In particular, he proposed to remove all large homeless encampments in six months, wean downtown San Francisco off of its dependence on the tech industry, increase police staffing levels and open 24/7 clinics for drug users. <br><br>But, like others, he contrasted the San Francisco of today with earlier, better times. In the old days, if you told someone you were from San Francisco, said the 50-year-old San Francisco native, “It was met with a sense of awe, a sense of wonderment, even envy. And today you get, ‘Are you okay?’”<br><br>As he sees it, San Francisco’s public safety, street conditions and economy have never been worse. And that’s mostly due to a “plain and simply failed leadership,” said Farrell. San Francisco used to have more than 2,300 police officers when Ed Lee was the mayor and Farrell was a supervisor, he said. The same number now stands at 1,857, according to the police department. Farrell mentioned former District Attorney Chesa Boudin for demoralizing the police department. <br><br>“Since I left office, our population has declined,”  he said. “So inherently, crime should decline because of that on its face.”<br><br>The crime rate, however, did decline. San Francisco saw fewer cases of both property crimes and violent crimes in 2023 than 2018, the year Farrell left office. <br><br>“We need to have law enforcement in San Francisco, just on principle, to create a civil society, to make sure there is deterrent,” he said. “In San Francisco, at times in the past, that has been foreign. But I think it’s just common sense that needs to be brought back.”<br><br>Farrell argued that his 7.5 years at City Hall — seven years as District 2 supervisor and six months as mayor after Ed Lee died — had equipped him with “a consistent track record” that voters could predict his performance in office. <br><br>To him, Mayor London Breed’s track record has been inconsistent on a number of issues. Regarding the abandoned downtown, he said Breed’s ideas make the city look disorganized: “What we heard was week one, we’re going to build science labs. Week two, we’re going to build housing. Week three, it was a U.C. campus, and then it became a soccer stadium.” <br><br>Michael Petrelis, who is running for District 9 supervisor, disrupted the conversation early on from outside the cafe, holding a sign that read “Ban cars now!” and interjecting frequently. He blared criticisms of Farrell from a bullhorn, but the volume on the speakers’ microphones was turned up, and Petrelis left after some 20 minutes. (We reported earlier that Petrelis attempted to shut down the event and left because he was tired. Petrelis wrote in an email, “My goal was not to stop the conversation and my cameraman had to leave because he had a date. I didn’t leave because I was tired.”<br><br>Macy’s recent closure announcement “caught the mayor’s office off guard, and City Hall off guard,” said Farrell, who noted similar situations also happened with Nordstrom and the San Francisco Centre’s closure. <br><br>Farrell said Breed’s office does not have relationships with the city’s largest tenants, largest building owners and the equity and debt behind them. This situation wouldn’t have happened if he were mayor, he said. He wouldn’t have been blindsided, and would’ve brought everyone together and worked out a solution comprehensively, he said. <br><br>As for plans for a downtown recovery, Farrell said he would first focus on addressing public safety and street conditions, to create an environment where employers and employees would be willing to come back.<br><br>“Diversification” was his diagnosis for downtown in the long term. “You know, we were over-reliant on the tech industry,” said Farrell. <br><br>“To the point where everyone wore the same vest,” noted Eskenazi.<br><br>“I’m glad I didn’t wear mine tonight,” said Farrell, who sported a black suit and white button-down. He noted that the tech industry’s tendency to work from home has turned San Francisco’s downtown into a veritable ghost town. <br><br>How would the public sector fix things that it neither created nor broke? Eskenazi asked.<br><br>The power of tax incentives, Farrell answered. In 2011, Mayor Lee and the Board of Supervisors, including Farrell, managed to use tax breaks to attract Twitter to revitalize mid-Market. “But it didn’t work. We learned our lessons as well,” he said. <br><br>Twitter brought a Silicon Valley model campus to San Francisco, having an in-house gym, an in-house cafe and even in-house dry cleaning, which prevented the surrounding neighborhoods from benefiting much, he said. “If we do this again, we have to do it in a much different, much smarter way,” he said. <br><br>“I think unless we’re aggressive about [reviving downtown], we’re going to lose downtown forever in a potential way,” he said. <br><br>Farrell also wants cars back on Market Street. “Let’s just have common sense again,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to admit that taking cars off Market Street, it’s not a panacea.”<br><br>“Market Street hasn’t been safer, statistically, since we took cars off Market Street,” Farrell said. <br><br>Contrasting Farrell’s citation of statistics regarding street safety — but not crime, in which people “feel” less safe in spite of statistically lower levels, Eskenazi quipped “But I feel safer.” <br><br>As for this week’s tragic car collision at West Portal which killed a family of four, Farrell said the lesson he drew was that the city should be “very granular” about every single intersection. He said he learned from friends who live in West Portal that, prior to the accident, the local community had sent multiple emails to the city saying it was a dangerous intersection, emails that went unheeded.<br><br>When asked who he would fire as mayor, Farrell mentioned the head of SFMTA, Jeffrey Tumlin, to promote public transportation, bicycling and pedestrian safety. In particular, he mentioned SFMTA’s L Taraval Project. “You tore up the street. You took away every single parking spot in the name of increasing the time or decreasing the time it will take for a trolley to get down the road and down. But you know what you’re also doing? Killing. You’re killing a lot of small businesses,” he said. <br><br>And Police Chief Bill Scott, whom Farrell called “a very good man” who had simply been in the position too long. “At the end of the day, the average tenure of a police chief in the U.S. is three years, and he has been here for almost eight,” Farrell said. <br><br>Farrell also intends to back city charter reform on November’s ballot, to guarantee the mayor always has the power to fire or hire department heads in a “plain and simple” way. This week, Farrell created a political action committee to push two ballot measures that would do just that, while also allowing the mayoral candidate to seek unlimited campaign donations to ostensibly back those ballot measures.<br><br>Asked whether he would support Breed’s recent veto of Board President Aaron Peskin’s legislation limiting density in areas of his district, Farrell said he would.<br><br>“I need you to speak loudly so the people in District 2 can hear you,” Eskenazi said. Would they want 270-foot high-rises in their neighborhoods? <br><br>It’s not about housing, but about “sloppy legislation” inside City Hall, said Farrell. “We had last summer’s density increases that everyone agreed upon. We come a few months later and say, ‘Whoops, I didn’t mean that we’re going to density decrease.’”<br><br>Farrell sought to sidestep a pro-housing or anti-housing characterization, falling back on his “common sense” pitch.<br><br>“Where is this common sense, once again?” said Farrell. “This gets back to the YIMBY, NIMBY, different sides of the aisle, where it’s just a zero-sum game and somebody has to win. Unless you’re fully with us, you’re off the boat.”<br><br>“I do not believe that we need to upzone every single neighborhood in San Francisco,” he added, saying it is the wrong approach. “As is the approach to say that we’re not going to build anywhere in San Francisco. We can do it in a very smart manner.”<br><br>Farrell also promised to take out all the large homeless encampments in six months by offering residents shelter, which he did as mayor in 2018, he said. <br><br>He suggested having clinics for substance use care open 24/7. “We have to capture [drug users] when they’re willing to make a different decision. And to give them a chance for a better life,” he said.<br><br>And, on Day One, he would audit all of the San Francisco nonprofits working on homelessness, because the city is funding a large amount of overlapping services, he said. There could be as many as nine city departments that fund homeless spending, he said. “Many fund the same nonprofit, but don’t realize that they’re doing it, and have different metrics for how they’re measuring success.”<br><br>Asked which past mayor he would seek to emulate, Farrell pointed to traits of several different city leaders. Farrell appreciated former Mayor Willie Brown’s ability to simply get things done, he said, and Gavin Newsom’s bold approach to politics and policy. He aspired to Ed Lee’s patience and Dianne Feinstein’s genuine love of San Francisco. <br><br>He chose not to answer who his ranked-choice alliance would be, saying it was premature, but acknowledged that it would be a part of any mayoral candidate’s strategy. <br><br>If elected, Farrell, who was the longest-serving Board of Supervisors budget chair in San Francisco’s history, will also be one of the first — if not the first — mayors of a major American city who is a venture capitalist. His finance background, he said, would be “super relevant” to the fate of San Francisco, a city that has a projected budget deficit of $728 million in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, and a 36 percent office-vacancy rate. <br><br>“It is amazing to me that what City Hall is turning to is just a blame game … No one’s willing to take leadership and accountability,” he said. “We need that back in San Francisco if we’re going to bring our city back.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mark-farrells-common-sense/
6a28db66-11b6-4e42-a581-4461946a378d,news,mission,RESTAURANT REVIEWS,MARIA C. ASCARRUNZ,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:40 AM","Review: Foliage, Precita Park spot offering prix fixe menu, can do better",,"Foliage opened in October 2023 in the space vacated by Michelin-starred Marlena, which has since moved to Japantown as the already acclaimed Adams 7 — Japantown’s gain, our loss. <br><br>Foliage owners Stephane Roulland and Julia Indovina brought in Chef Mo Béjar to the beautiful corner space by Precita Park. When my editor asked me to review the new restaurant at their publicist’s request, I was salivating at the prospect of trying another somewhat affordable ($75) prix-fixe menu in the area. Béjar hails from the Central Valley, and his dishes have the requisite farm-to-table, sustainable and beautiful aesthetic, and they sounded interesting and fresh, with a few culinary twists and turns. <br><br>We started out with the house-made milk bread with cultured butter. The other option was the bread with a spiced salt and Spanish jamón, but we went for the basic. <br><br>This gorgeous golden orb came to the table, warm and inviting, with a very generous slab of butter, gleaming with crystals of crunchy salt. Plenty for us to have two wedges apiece, the interior was fluffy and yeasty, and gave us high hopes for the rest of the meal. Besides, who ever gives you enough butter with your bread? <br><br>The prix-fixe menu at Foliage offers two options per course, plus some optional add-ons. We decided to get each of the options, so that we would get to taste everything.<br><br>First course: Amberjack crudo with lacto-fermented pineapple, banana, macadamia nuts, and thinly sliced kohlrabi. <br><br>The vegetarian option: Avocado with essentially the same ingredients.<br><br>Both had a little funk, with an inexplicable paprika oil at the bottom of the bowls. The amberjack was lovely, but it was an odd combination of flavors; banana and fish connote a somewhat Caribbean vibe, but it didn’t really work for us. We were also a bit puzzled about the choice to take the same ingredients and simply substitute avocado for the protein. It seemed to me that here was a perfect, missed opportunity to make a wholly different, inventive vegetarian option. While we weren’t thrilled with the amberjack dish, the vegetarian option was lackluster. <br><br>Second course: Shrimp toast and ricotta gnocchi.<br><br>Beautiful dishes, both. The Foliage shrimp toast was wonderful; super crispy, light, highly spiced, with a Sichuan peppercorn aioli, and perfectly cooked shrimp. I’d get it again (and, in fact, I did). Our only quibble was the Osetra caviar was wasted on this. You literally could not taste it with everything else going on.<br><br>The gnocchi dish came with a lovely gorgonzola sauce, pooled under beautifully wilted and browned sweet cabbage, topped with fried sage and toasted nuts. Unfortunately, the cabbage was the best thing on the plate; the ricotta gnocchi themselves were severely tough and dense. We found them inedible, and when the runner eventually came around to ask if he could take the plate (without asking why the dish was untouched), I told him that the gnocchi were very hard. He apologized profusely and said he would tell the chef. When he returned, he informed us the chef admitted that they were usually softer, and asked if we wanted him to try making them again, or did we want another shrimp toast? Perhaps we should have taken him up on the offer for a re-do, but we took the safe-bet toast. My question is: How does that go out to a table? And were others eating those heavy gnocchi without complaint?<br><br>At that point, the courses seemed to have slowed down. I’d finished a glass of Cremant bubbly, and asked the runner for the list so I could order a glass of wine. He misheard me, and brought another glass of the same sparkling wine. He apologized, and began to take it back, but my sister said she would just take it so it wouldn’t go to waste. She hadn’t planned on having alcohol with dinner. I ordered a very good cabernet.<br><br>Next came our entrée courses. The options were local cod over sweet potato puree with fava greens and charred leeks, or roasted cauliflower with a vadouvan crema for the vegetarian dish. Or, for an additional $15, a coulotte steak (described by our server as “the best cut, the top of the sirloin.”) with mole, chayote, citrus, and chocolate jus. Sold! We ordered the fish and the steak.<br><br>The cod was a bit on the small side, slightly overdone, the skin could have been a little crisper for my taste, but overall had good flavor. The underlying sweet potato puree and leeks were good, the garum (an ancient Roman fish sauce) very subtle. I was busy eating my portion of the fish before switching off with my sister, so I didn’t notice she was having trouble with the steak.<br><br>When they first put the dish on the table, I asked if the thin brown sauce underneath the steak was the mole, and our runner said no, that’s the chocolate jus. A minute later, the chef himself came by with an extra little ramekin of the orange mole, which had been hiding under the chayote. A nice gesture, though I hadn’t asked for more; I just hadn’t seen it on the plate. We chatted with Chef Béjar a few minutes, asked where he’d cooked before, wished him well. <br><br>The steak was rare (which we both like), and I finally noticed my sister sawing away at the meat for an interminable amount of time. She looked at me in disbelief. “You need to cut this into really small pieces, or you won’t be able to chew it.” I tried my hand at it and, sure enough, it took at least 10 seconds to hack free a tiny piece, and then another 10 to chew it until it was soft enough to swallow. Again, we just could not eat it. The Foliage mole itself was — sorry, the only word I can think of is strange — citrusy, and unlike any other mole I’d ever had. The chayote was hard and flavorless. Our server finally came by and asked us how we were enjoying the course as she stared at the full plate. I demonstrated how hard it was to cut through the meat. She replied, “Yes, because it’s a very chewy cut.” Before I could show my amazement at this explanation, she quickly asked if she should take it away and I said “yes, please.”<br><br>In all the time I’ve been reviewing for Mission Local, I really can’t remember sending a dish back, much less two in one meal. By this point, we were looking around at the quite full restaurant and wondering if it was just us? We’re normally not that picky (in fact, I often get accused of liking everything indiscriminately), and we don’t relish making a scene. It was baffling, as no one else seemed to be having an issue, but seemed to be enjoying their meals thoroughly. <br><br>Dessert course: One was a mango semifreddo with tuile crumbles, a little mango jelly, and mint. <br><br>“Semifreddo” means “partially frozen.” The ice cream here, unfortunately, was a solid disk, and we had to wait a bit for it to soften. It tasted fine, however; very subtly mango flavored. <br><br>The other dessert was a white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries. The panna cotta was nicely creamy and, thankfully, not too sweet. All in all, there was nothing wrong with the desserts; they were simply unremarkable.<br><br>And the perfect ending to our meal? As I reached for the bill, my hand hit my glass which still had some wine in it — only my second glass of the evening, mind you — and in dramatic fashion knocked it onto the table, smashing it loudly, flinging wine and bits of glass everywhere. A shard actually drew blood from my sister’s hand. Mortified, I now saw myself through the eyes of our servers and chef: “Oh, was that the drunk woman who complained about everything?” I apologized over and over, all were gracious, mopping up the mess and making light of the incident. The Foliage staff handled it with class and kindness.<br><br>They also graciously took the $15 steak off our bill without my asking, charged us for the wine that was a mistake (which, yes, we’d drank), and handed us a bill for close to $250. <br><br>It truly pains me to write a review like this. Anyone can make a mistake; a bad dish can happen to any kitchen, but don’t send it out. If a cut of beef is so chewy, cook it some other way. The deficiencies in the dishes we disliked were basic errors in execution. I know it is an excruciatingly difficult thing to open, run, and maintain a restaurant for any length of time, in this city, or anywhere. What a feather in Chef Béjar’s cap to have opened in this lovely space, with a ready-made clientele mourning the loss of their beloved Marlena. (NB: I never told anyone at the restaurant that I was reviewing that night, even though we’d been asked to do so.)<br><br>I’m hoping this was simply an anomaly, as I’m rooting for Chef Béjar to achieve success in that space, and for Foliage to become a neighborhood mainstay, as I’m sure the Precita Park community is hoping as well. <br><br>Foliage SF (website)

6e966e4e-493f-4524-b39e-7aa69ab3c3cb,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,KELLY WALDRON,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:00 AM",District 7 candidates talk road safety after West Portal fatal crash,,"On March 16, a family of four was killed when a woman drove an SUV into a bus stop in West Portal, which is part of District 7. <br><br>The family — Matilde Ramos Pinto, Diego Cardoso de Oliveira and their two young children — were standing at the bus stop at Ulloa Street and Lenox Way. It was the day of their wedding anniversary, and they were waiting for the bus to go to the zoo. <br><br>The driver, Mary Fong Lau, 78, was driving the wrong way down Ulloa Street.

Likewise, the two other candidates noted that lack of traffic enforcement is an issue. <br><br>Traffic enforcement has collapsed across San Francisco since 2014, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Police officers are issuing a small fraction of the citations they did 10 years ago, leading supervisors to hold pointed inquiries into the problem last year. <br><br>Melgar, for her part, pointed to both enforcement and slowing down cars, alongside physical protective infrastructure like bollards. She also went further by suggesting that certain areas around public transportation hubs should be fully pedestrianized and closed to cars altogether. <br><br>Their answers are below, but I also wanted to let you know that I will be in your district on Monday, March 25 at 1 p.m. at Ballast Coffee (329 West Portal Ave.).

Around it, a flow of pedestrians and bicycles stream through the intersection, hardly noticing the felled former silk oak.<br><br>But the stump is new; it’s the remnant of a silk oak — which, despite its name, is not an oak at all but part of a completely different family of trees — that city crews cut down on March 16. Its exact age and height were not recorded by the city, but it was at least 30 years old and 50 feet tall, according to an estimate by Allegra Mautner, a Public Works urban forestry inspector who has kept an eye on the tree. <br><br>“It was kind of sad,” said Cassandra, who works at the nearby Fellow Barber. “It was just here one day, and then it was gone the next.”<br><br>The tree’s death sentence was issued only after multiple discussions, “because it’s such a high-profile tree, and it’s so important to a lot of members of the community,” said Mautner. Earlier, she discussed the issue with multiple supervisors at San Francisco Public Works before defining the tree a hazard that needed to be removed. <br><br>“It’s a very respectful tree,” said Mautner, who’s now going through a process of coming to terms with the decision. “Every time I biked past that tree after I made that decision, I always felt like, ‘Am I making the right decision?’”<br><br>The coup de grâce for the silk oak came in February during a series of windstorms. It dropped several large limbs, and that was that. <br><br>In addition, the tree’s excessive size had rendered its surrounding sidewalk a tripping hazard, impassable for people with disabilities. This constricted foot traffic and activities at a busy intersection, according to Mautner, one of San Francisco’s five urban forestry inspectors who collectively oversee the city’s roughly 125,000 street trees.<br><br>“This tree is very close to me,” she said. She has lived about a block from the silk oak since 2012, and she bikes past it every day on her commute. She took a longer look at the tree during the pandemic, when she did a lot of walking. She noticed the tree because it was a species she had never seen before. <br><br>But that was also one of the factors necessitating its removal. “It had very poor structure, which is common for this species,” Mautner said. Plus, because of frequent failures of small limbs, the tree’s crown had grown much smaller over the past several years. Its roots also topped the sidewalk, and became more unstable after the recent storms washed out some of the soil underneath. <br><br>“We really do try to maintain large trees in the urban environment, because they add so many benefits. but we also have to balance the risk that they pose to the public,” Mautner said. Throughout the years, the urban forestry team had added some asphalt patches to temporarily fix the area around the oak. These had degraded over time. City officials also considered a longer term-fix of doing more sidewalk work, but that was deemed infeasible because of the tree’s massive root structure.<br><br>Its size also prevented it from being transplanted. And even if moving the tree were an option, its deteriorating health made the odds of it surviving a transplant low.<br><br>Mautner conducted a final assessment in February, and deemed the silk oak a hazard. “I’m such a tree hugger. Then I have people who tell me that I’m such a tree hater, and I want to remove all the trees in San Francisco,” said the 34-year-old University of California, Berkeley, forestry major. <br><br>Between Feb. 12 to 27, tree removal notifications were posted on its trunk, on the street light posts around it, and on the Public Works website. With an annual tree mortality rate of four percent in San Francisco, Mautner posts new removal notices almost every week to let the community know in advance that a tree is leaving. <br><br>No one protested. <br><br>Mautner took some selfies with the silk oak when she knew it would soon be gone. On March 15, an arborist removed the tree. Soon, the whole site will be paved over. <br><br>A few days ago, Mautner passed an indigenous ceremony in front of City College’s Mission campus on her way home. She knew it wasn’t related. But it struck a chord with her. <br><br>She took comfort in knowing that “the tree had seen so many activities like this, so many marches came by and it lived a good, long life. We were able to keep this tree for a long period of time.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/the-50-foot-oak-that-towered-over-valencia-and-18th-for-at-least-30-years-is-now-a-stump/
1eaa6c97-a470-48d1-a5d9-b2f840179a76,news,mission,COMMUNITY,BETH WINEGARNER,"MARCH 22, 2024, 6:00 AM",Mission Dolores curator aims to humanize site’s indigenous dead,,"For more than 30 years, Mission Dolores curator Andrew Galvan has been on a quest: To memorialize more than 5,000 indigenous people buried in the mission’s cemetery, some of whom are Galvan’s own ancestors. <br><br>Galvan, a former archaeological consultant, remembers visiting Monsignor John O’Connor at Mission Dolores, the basilica’s pastor from 1983 to 1999, in the early 1990s, when the historic site was getting ready for a post-Loma Prieta seismic retrofit.<br><br>“We were having afternoon tea. He brought out the burial register and baptismal records, and we found my ancestors,” he said. <br><br>Galvan’s ancestor, Liberato Culpecse, was baptized in 1801 at Mission Dolores, but later moved to Mission San Jose. Culpecse’s parents, Jobocme and Poylemja, are buried in the mission’s cemetery, along with 5,700 other indigenous people, in unmarked graves. After seeing their names in these 200-year-old books, Galvan started thinking about ways to make all those ancestors more visible. <br><br>“I’ve collected the names of the Indians who were here during the Mission period,” Galvan said one afternoon in January, sitting in the pews of the old mission church. “Originally, I thought I could add an adobe wall and create plaques with all of the names. But even in 1992, it would have cost $1 million.”<br><br>Today, Galvan hopes to build a new, bigger museum on the Mission Dolores property that would include space for a plaque bearing the 5,700 names. The mission already has a small, one-room museum, but this one would extend into the adjacent playground for Mission Dolores Academy — which is part of the mission property, and was built over part of the mission’s cemetery. But the price tag has gone up: Galvan estimates the museum would cost $3 million to $4 million to build, and has only received donations covering a fraction of that amount. <br><br>As he pursues his quest, Galvan said he’ll need to reach out to local tribal groups to get their input. <br><br>“It would be a wonderful way for us to bring it into conversation, their actual names,” said Corinna Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in Oakland, the only local tribal group to respond to Mission Local’s requests for comment. “Giving them names helps to humanize them, which has been difficult for a long time in the Bay Area.”<br><br>Indigenous people have lived on the San Francisco peninsula for more than 13,000 years. In San Francisco, the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in several villages, including one near the present-day mission site, called Chutchui, on the banks of a waterway they named Ehwate. When Franciscan monks, under the guidance of Junipero Serra, arrived in 1776, they decided that Chutchui was the perfect site to build a mission. <br><br>The Franciscans forced indigenous residents into labor. The mission church and other structures, including barns and barracks, were constructed by indigenous hands; not just Ohlone, but also Pomo, Miwok, Patwin and Wappo people from the wider Bay Area. <br><br>Missionaries baptized the indigenous people who lived and worked at the mission, stripping them of their given names and rebranding them with Spanish ones. The hard work, near-starvation rations and waves of infectious illness killed thousands of indigenous people at the site. Galvan wants their names — their indigenous names — to be known again. <br><br>Facing the steep cost of creating a memorial in the ‘90s, Mission leaders put Galvan’s memorial plaque idea on the back burner. O’Connor moved to another post in 1997, and it wasn’t until Galvan was hired as the mission’s curator in 2004 that he picked up the idea again. He wrote a number of proposals and grant requests, including one to the California Missions Foundation for what he called an “Indian memorial” at Mission Dolores. <br><br>“The response I got from the committee was, “What about the names of the Spanish and Irish people buried there?’” Galvan recalled. “I said, ‘It says Indian memorial.’” The grant wasn’t approved. <br><br>In 2009, the mission hired Galvan’s cousin, Vincent Medina (who’s now co-founder of Cafe Ohlone in Berkeley) as assistant curator, and the cousins took matters into their own hands. They bought a pair of redwood boards from Home Depot and carved the names of Jobocme and Poylemja — who are Medina’s ancestors, too — into the wood. They now stand in the mission cemetery. <br><br>“The grave marker in the center of the cemetery is a tangible piece that visitors, community members, and family members can visit that gives proof to specific Native people buried at Mission Dolores. It gives recognition to two of the individuals that are interred there, and even without much label copy tells a story that is necessary to tell,” Galvan and Medina wrote in an academic article published in 2018. <br><br>In that article, they proposed projecting the indigenous dead’s names onto a wall at Mission Dolores. That, too, proved difficult and expensive: None of the mission’s current spaces are quite dark enough, and the projector would burn through about $150 a month in lightbulbs. <br><br>In any case, “I want something permanent, and having it adjacent to the graves makes the most sense,” Galvan said. In 2022, he assisted in creating a similar monument at the Franciscan mission in Sonoma, which reads, “In this sacred grounds lie buried men, women and children of the local Coast Miwok, Patwin, Wappo and Pomo tribes. They built, labored and died at Mission San Francisco Solano.” The site includes a stone etched with the names of 896 indigenous people buried there. <br><br>Burying people in the ground and marking them with individual stones isn’t the traditional way local indigenous people honor their ancestors, though many do it that way today, said Gould, the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust co-founder. Historically, most buried their dead in large shellmounds that were built up with seashells, earth and other materials, and located them within their villages, so the living wouldn’t be separated from them, she said.<br><br>Sogorea Te’ works in the East Bay to reclaim local land and steward it in indigenous ways. Recently, the nonprofit opened ‘Ookwe Park through an adopt-a-park program in Richmond, where tribes will grow and harvest medicinal plants, including yerba buena, mugwort, wild strawberries and soaproot. The site once held a shellmound, which was destroyed in the construction of the Officer Bradley Moody Memorial Underpass, Gould said.<br><br>It also purchased the embattled West Berkeley Shellmound site in March, formerly the location of a village and massive shellmound that covered many city blocks, all the way to the waterfront. The group plans to unearth Strawberry Creek, currently streaming underground, and build a new, poppy-covered shellmound that visitors can climb. <br><br>“We can show the magnitude of what a shellmound was. People can stand up high and see, similar to what my ancestors would have seen,” Gould said. The site will represent “not just the past and the horrific things that happened, but the resilience.” <br><br>Although Gould thinks Galvan is on the right track, she called the Mission Dolores memorial “a first step.” The Catholic Church extensively harmed the indigenous people of California, and owes them “some kind of reciprocity,” or even giving Chutchui land back to the Ramaytush Ohlone, she said. <br><br>Jonathan Cordero, founder and executive director of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, said the organization is working on some land-back initiatives in San Francisco, but none involving the Mission Dolores area. He declined to comment on the memorial plan.<br><br>For now, it’s unclear whether Mission Dolores will be able to raise enough money to bring its indigenous dead back into the light. Donations of any amount are welcome, Galvan said. <br><br>Disclosure: Beth Winegarner donates a small amount of money each year to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust and the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mission-dolores-curator-aims-to-humanize-sites-indigenous-dead/

San Francisco jail records reveal that Ellicott, 38, was booked at 9:07 this morning and is being held on $50,000 bail for his 62 felony charges.<br><br>He is accused of establishing a bogus company and using it to loot the very branch of the HR department that he was charged with keeping both technically and monetarily sound. <br><br>“The charges announced today reflect my office’s continuing commitment to uncover official misconduct in San Francisco’s City government,” District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement.  “My office would like to thank the Department of Human Resources for its swift and thorough cooperation in uncovering the depths of their trusted manager’s great betrayal.” <br><br>The January and March cases against Ellicott are unrelated, but it was the investigation into the former that led to today’s arrest and charging. In addition to allegedly selling high-end consumer electronics bought with emergency supply money, Ellicott was charged in January with participating in a larger municipal theft and kickback scheme operated by former Community Challenge Grant director Lanita Henriquez and former Gavin Newsom mayoral staffer, businessman and city fixer Dwayne Jones. <br><br>The District Attorney alleges that Jones’ company, RDJ Enterprises, paid Ellicott — a city employee at that time — nearly $270,000 over the course of four years. Ellicott then purportedly used Venmo and PayPal to funnel some $65,650 of Jones’ money to Henriquez. <br><br>In an affidavit released today, DA investigator Mike Reilly reveals that scrutiny of Ellicott’s financial transactions regarding the earlier case unearthed a “long series of unusual deposits” into his personal bank account totaling more than $450,000. These payments emanated from a source the DA refers to only as “Witness 1,” a Chicagoan. <br><br>Reilly reached “Witness 1,” who told him her old college pal Ellicott paid her $1,000 in 2019 to establish a company called IAG Services, and to set up a bank account for IAG services using her own name and information. She said Ellicott then took over the account. <br><br>Department of Human Resources managers confirmed to Reilly that Ellicott himself added IAG Services as a vendor into the city system in May 2019. Starting that month and continuing until January 2024 — the month of his prior arrest — more than $627,000 in payments were made from the city to IAG. These “appeared to be fraudulent payments related to otherwise legitimate workers’ compensation benefits.”<br><br>While these payments were ostensibly for “auditing services,” human resources managers told Reilly that no paperwork exists to indicate that any auditing services were actually performed. Ellicott’s former colleagues were unable to locate invoices for most of the payments to IAG, and those they did locate were all approved by Ellicott himself. <br><br>All told, the human resources department provided the DA with 643 workers’ comp claims billed to IAG. Most were billed just once, with a payment between $925 and $986. Between 2019 and January 2024, the total amount paid was $627,118.86. Email records indicate Ellicott either approved these payments himself, or asked colleagues to process them. <br><br>The DA investigator traced more than $450,400 in payments from IAG to Ellicott’s personal bank account over the course of four years. These semi-monthly payments were denoted “Direct Deposit [Witness 1] D BILL PMT BILL PMT.” It was this series of regular payments that first caught investigator Reilly’s eye.<br><br>Following Henriquez’s arrest in August 2023, these payments were purportedly redirected to a different account tied to Ellicott. All told, the DA claims more than $488,000 was transferred between IAG and multiple Ellicott accounts. <br><br>Ellicott began working for the city in 2012, with a brief hiatus between 2015 and 2016. He was a manager at the human resources department from 2017 until January 25 of this year, when he was placed on paid leave.<br><br>Transparent California lists Ellicott’s 2022 pay as $187,884, with benefits of $55,613, for a total compensation package of $243,496. His most recent position with the human resources department was “assistant director of finance and technology.” The human resources department describes his position as being “responsible for the financial integrity of the Workers’ Compensation Division” — the division he oversaw and allegedly looted.<br><br>The Department of Human Resources announced today that it has implemented new controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.<br><br>Ellicott’s 62 charges include grand theft, misappropriation of public money, insurance fraud and money laundering. He was arrested “without incident” this morning at his Oakland home, and will face arraignment tomorrow.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/stanley-ellicott-workers-comp/

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/

Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
510306ce-ce68-4ff4-a070-1e7b5f5d1fae,news,richmond,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete.

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice.

3ebb6ea8-861f-43f7-981e-56a016fa5b87,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!<br><br>I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.<br><br>You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.<br><br>Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.<br><br>Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.<br><br>Vince Yuen

8a81ed95-d50a-4736-8146-6ffe00b86b8d,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Press Release: Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Milestone,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Another Milestone<br><br>The City and Alexandria Theater Developer Sign Initial Agreement<br><br>Today, Supervisor Connie Chan announced the initial agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was signed jointly by TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC and the Office of Workforce and Economic Development. Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
d757c2e7-9d65-44fb-b153-8d66a5b37bb5,news,sunset,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

District 2 Supervisor Catherine Stefani recused herself from representation because her husband owns a boat in the marina. The grassroots group “Keep The Waterfront Open” collected more than 2,500 signatures opposing plans that would remove boats located at Gashouse Cove — part of the Marina Small Craft Harbor since the 1960s — so that PG&E can “decontaminate the water.” Along with removal of the wooden slips and the only public fuel dock in town, the view of bobbing masts would be gone forever.

Critics say the plan is really about the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department’s desire to accommodate much larger yachts, which would further restrict views from the Marina Green but would increase revenue flow to the agency, all while allowing PG&E to save millions by doing a less than adequate cleanup of its toxins under the water of the adjacent Gashouse Cove.

With Stefani abstaining, the city charter says “the privilege of the floor shall not be granted, for any purpose, to persons other than officers of the City or their duly authorized representatives. This rule shall not be suspended except by unanimous consent of all Supervisors present,” which leaves residents without representation from their elected supervisor.

At an Oct. 19 meeting, Rec and Park voted to move forward with an environmental impact review for the proposed plan, despite local opposition.",https://www.marinatimes.com/controversial-harbor-threatens-marina-green-view
c17bbb54-d9a9-4391-b954-842737f43373,news,marina,NEWS BRIEFS,by Marina Times Staff,SEPTEMBER 2023,Jump starting businesses in our neighborhoods,,"It’s well-known that the city’s permitting process for small businesses is laborious. Add to that the challenge of high rents; hiring; crime; and the pandemic, which forced the closure of many businesses, owning or opening a small business in the city is challenging. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 20 percent of new businesses fail, and some reports are that it is higher in San Francisco.

There may be hope: Earlier this year, Mayor London Breed proposed legislation to improve the permitting process with more than 100 changes to the current Planning Code. Among the proposed changes are allowing more business uses on ground floors to help fill commercial vacancies; lifting restrictions on restaurants and bars in certain neighborhoods — including Union Street; easing the legalization process for existing outdoor patios; and enabling nighttime entertainment, bars, and restaurants to benefit from priority permit processing.

The legislation is in part designed to provide small businesses the ability to adapt to a “flexible retail” model, which currently is allowed only in certain districts, and would accommodate changing circumstances, such as the pandemic and consumer behavior. That model would allow previously existing business to change to a different use without having to reapply to the city for new permits for each change.

The Planning Commission will consider these changes in a public meeting on Sept 7.",https://www.marinatimes.com/jump-starting-businesses-in-our-neighborhoods
d2f11b34-fe87-4144-a025-1416d3754b52,news,marina,NEWS,by Marina Times Staff,,APEC 2023 Conference Briefing on Burns Highlighted Challenges in Burn Injury,,"The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which hosted its 2023 Conference Briefing on Burns on Aug. 30, saw a distinguished lineup of speakers in the global burn treatment community addressing the pressing issue of burn injury and burn care in their countries throughout the Asia-Pacific. The conference briefing is one of many such briefings and satellite meetings happening in advance of the 2023 APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting where global leaders and heads of state will descend in November on San Francisco, this year’s host city. 

Kicking off the conference on burns, Kevin Xu, president of MEBO Group and co-chair of the APEC 2023 Host Committee, and an investor in Street Media, delivered the opening remarks. He called for a diverse range of voices to be heard at this year’s meeting, stressing the importance of contributions from sectors such as NGOs and medical associations.

Then, Dr. Tina L. Palmieri, assistant chief of burns at Shriners Children’s Northern California; burn division chief at the University of California, Davis; past-president ABA, current ISBI treasurer, expressed her thanks for Kevin’s insightful remarks. She proceeded to highlight the substantial global impact of burns, particularly within APEC nations, and noted the alarming increase in incidents of fires worldwide.

Dr. Robert Cartotto, president of the American Burn Association, shared a poignant story of his patient John, a burn survivor of a car accident, and he underscored the profound physical and psychological effects of burns for the patient. Dr. Cartotto then delved into the broader economic implications of burns in Canada, along with the nation’s approach to burn care. He revealed that around 25,000 Canadians sought emergency care for burn injuries, while 2,500 were hospitalized due to burns.

Dr. Jeremy Rawlins, president of the Australia/New Zealand Burn Association recounted his personal experience of a minor burn that disrupted his work routine. He then discussed the escalating frequency of wildfires in Australia, resulting in substantial economic and human life losses for the nation. He specifically mentioned that barbecues were a prominent cause of burn injuries in Australia.

Addressing the burn situation in India, Dr. Rajeev Ahuja, founding president of the Asia Pacific Burn Association, revealed that approximately five million Indians live with disabilities resulting from burn injuries. Moreover, half of India’s burn victims suffer from burns with more than 50 percent of total body surface area. He highlighted the correlation between burn injuries and poverty, and introduced the challenges India faced in burn management.

Dr. Folke Sjoberg, president of the International Society for Burn Injuries provided an overview of the society, its evolution, and its diverse and multidisciplinary teams. He also highlighted the advancements in global burn care.

Dr. Ariel Miranda, secretary of the ISBI and a plastic surgeon and chief of the pediatric burn unit in Guadalajara, Mexico discussed the organization’s objectives, including collaboration with NGOs and prioritized inclusion of low-income nations as members. He also elaborated on the benefits of joining ISBI and the society’s developmental strategies.

As a corporate partner and organizing committee member of the APEC 2023 Conference, MEBO Group would launch peripheral activities centering around wound care and burn management during the event, bringing together international scholars and experts in the field to offer solutions and strategic insights to conference participants.",https://www.marinatimes.com/apec-2023-conference-briefing-on-burns-highlighted-challenges-in-burn-injury

My scads of rubber bands, paper clips, and miscellaneous art items I periodically drive down to Scrap; bubble wrap and air pillows to Tony at the Postal Chase on Fillmore Street; plastic bags to Safeway — you get the idea. Although Recology has stepped up their game a bit, there are still some unrecyclable materials that unfortunately end up in the black bin.

Enter Ridwell, a company with a half dozen locations across the country that has recently landed in the Bay Area. Ridwell picks up multilayer plastic (chip bags and the like); plastic films; clothes, shoes, and textiles; lightbulbs, and more every two weeks. They provide marked cloth bags/boxes and pick up directly from your front door and deliver to recyclers like Scrap that reuse the items or others that recycle the materials to produce new items, like ByFusion, which turns multilayer plastic into construction-grade building blocks. 

What’s more, they are transparent about what goes where, which is listed on their website along with percentages of diverted materials and contamination, and they audit and track the items to ensure they reach their partner destinations.

Porter, who won the November midterm election against Orange County Republican Scott Baugh with a 51.72% to 48.28% vote count, stated that California needs a “warrior” in Washington and expressed her intent to challenge the status quo and hold powerful entities such as Wall Street, Big Oil and Big Pharma accountable. 

Her announcement was made with the aim of taking the seat of Senator Dianne Feinstein, who hasn’t declared intentions to run again for 2024 and has been criticized for staying in office despite her advanced age. 

In response, Baugh took to Twitter to announce he would be running for the 47th Congressional District Representative again in 2024.",https://www.marinatimes.com/congresswoman-katie-porter-to-run-for-senate
e0ea4081-943e-4729-b007-99a00b6b0370,news,marina,NEWS,by LA WEEKLY,,Coachella 2023 Line-up Announced,,"Coachella, located in Indio, California, just released its 2023 line-up, with Bad Bunny, BLACKPINK and Frank Ocean as headliners. Calvin Harris is at the bottom of the line-up and is referred to as “Returning to the Desert,” implying that he has yet to be assigned a specific performance date. 

The festival is taking place over the weekends of April 14th-16th and April 21st-23rd, and will be the first Coachella not to land on Easter Sunday, which is on April 9th this year. 

Friday’s roster consists of some beloved acts such as Gorillaz, The Chemical Brothers and Blondie, as well as Latin singer Becky G and Nigerian superstar Burna Boy. Rosalía, Charlie XCX, Labrinth, boygenius and Underworld are playing on Saturday, and Sunday will conclude with Björk, Kali Uchis, Porter Robinson, Dominic Fike and Jai Paul, among others. Metro Boomin, Pusha T, Rae Sremmurd and Yung Lean are some of the rap artists that will be performing throughout the weekend. 

Frank Ocean is still on the bill, which is remarkable considering that he was initially planned to perform at the 2020 festival, which was canceled due to the pandemic, and was then expected to appear at the 2022 return, but was ultimately left out. Coachella made an uncharacteristic early announcement of his return for 2023. Frank Ocean has a history of cancelling festival appearances, including the 2015 FYF Fest in Los Angeles, which was filled in by Kanye West. He returned for the 2017 FYF Fest and gave a show-stopping performance with the help of Brad Pitt. 

The other headliners demonstrate the increasing worldwide sound that Coachella is incorporating, with Latin superstar Bad Bunny leading the way and BLACKPINK being the first K-pop group to headline the festival. BLACKPINK made their Coachella debut in 2019 as the first all-female K-pop act, and their headline status this year is a testament to the rising popularity of K-pop.

“Everyday I hear from San Franciscans who are concerned about crime in our city, and I take this issue extremely seriously,” Stefani said in a statement.

Saying that her first priority “is to keep residents and visitors safe, and to make sure that small businesses can thrive,” Stefani said new patrols will be added, and an additional $300,000 will be used to add community ambassadors to the area. The Police Department’s Community Ambassador Program uses retired police officers to supplement foot beat patrols in business and commercial areas. 

KRON 4 quoted Police Chief Bill Scott saying that an increased police presence should be visible around the Palace of Fine Arts, Fillmore, Pacific Heights, Union Street, and other busy areas.

Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco in the House since 1987, used the announcement of her decision to usher in the next generation of Democratic House leadership, with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York expected to be the new minority leader.

Widely considered one of the most powerful House speakers in history — even ruefully by many Republican members of Congress — Pelosi’s announcement signaled not only a shift in generations but also a shift in regional power. Jeffries represents Brooklyn on the opposite coast from San Francisco. But if the current House Minority Leader succeeds in his effort to be elected speaker, California will retain that position. 

Pelosi was reelected to her House seat in November with 84 percent of the vote.

40e7aede-0b19-4d2b-a7b0-66a5bffca77d,news,ingleside,TRANSPORTATION,Jerold Chinn,"Mar 26, 2024",More Bay Wheels Bike Rental Stations Proposed For Ingleside,The Lyft-owned bike rental company wants to install several stations in and around Ingleside.,"The Lyft-owned Bay Wheels bike dock rental stations could be arriving in and around the Ingleside neighborhood pending approval by the city traffic engineer.

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency held a public hearing for proposed bike docking stations in District 7, including one on Ocean Avenue and Lakewood Avenue beside the El Rey Theatre, and another on Ocean Avenue and Junipero Serra Boulevard, adjacent to the Lakeside Landing lot. Both stations are proposed to be 62 feet long and would accommodate 23 bikes.

Another proposed location for a smaller bike docking station includes the intersection of St. Charles Avenue and Alemany Boulevard. The station would only be 35 feet long, allowing space for 13 bikes. Adrian Leung, the transportation agency’s bike share and bike parking program manager, said the station would be close to H MART.

Two other proposed locations, one at Vicente and West Portal avenues and another at 15th Avenue and Portola Drive, were taken off the agenda so the transportation agency staff could do more outreach to neighborhood stakeholders.

Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority said Tuesday that the Bay Wheels expansion in District 7 is funded by the Metropolitan Transportation Climate Initiatives Program.

Traffic Operations Manager Eddie Tsui said there were a handful of letters in support and opposition of the proposed station. No public comment was given on the item. The SFMTA received one email in opposition to the station proposed at Lakewood and Ocean avenues.

Residents spoke against the proposed station at St. Charles Avenue and Alemany Boulevard in the Merced Heights neighborhood, adding that it would impact parking in the neighborhood.

Claire Sanchez, a resident in the area, said St. Charles Avenue is already congested with San Francisco State University shuttle buses and the 54 Felton bus route has a stop at the intersection. Sanchez said the bike docking station should go elsewhere.

Some residents who spoke suggested the intersection of Alemany Boulevard and Arch Street to install the docking station. Leung, the bike share and parking manager, said that the agency had not found any other workable locations and that staff found Alemany and Arch would provide an uncomfortable ride for bicyclists as the street speed limit is 35 mph.

The SFMTA will post the results of the hearing by 5 p.m. on Friday on its website.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/bay-wheels-stations-proposal/
33437b96-720d-4ee0-b376-8a9d89bc38bd,news,ingleside,TRANSPORTATION,Jerold Chinn,"Mar 26, 2024",SFUSD To Hold Neighborhood Meeting On Its Future Thursday,The school district is crafting a plan that may involve consolidating and closing schools.,"The San Francisco Unified School District is seeking community feedback on its new resource alignment plan.

Following a period of declining enrollment, staffing and funding, SFUSD leaders met with the San Francisco Board of Education in August 2023 to discuss the state of the education system and to pitch the Resource Alignment Initiative, a plan that aims to align resources to education goals. Now, they are launching the next part of Phase 1 which includes community feedback from March to May 2024.

“We are committed to transparently engaging with the community throughout San Francisco in this process, and to offering multiple ways for anyone in the community, regardless of which neighborhood they reside in, to be involved,” said Laura Dudnick, the school district’s spokesperson.

In early March, the school district announced the initiative which included hosting meetings for five community focus group meetings in Sunset at Sunset Elementary School, Inner Richmond at Roosevelt Middle School, Chinatown at Gordon J. Lau Elementary School, Mission at Mission High School and Bayview at Willie Brown Middle School. They have since added groups in Ocean View at Sheridan Elementary School, Tenderloin at Tenderloin Community School and Portola at Burton High School.

Their plan focuses on five areas to achieve strong and supportive learning environments for their students. It includes creating a new school staffing model, reorganizing the central office, exploring ways to generate revenue from properties, investing in priority district-wide programs and creating a new school portfolio.

Implementation of this plan may also lead to the merger, co-location and/or closures of schools within the district, which the Board of Education will vote on in December 2024, and has parents concerned.

For Alicia Corwin, who works in education and has one child currently enrolled at Commodore Sloat Elementary and another entering the elementary school system soon, the possibility of school closures is worrisome.

“Our child's school is not one of the SFUSD schools that is commonly sought out and 'fought over' and so I think naturally there is worry,” Corwin said. “The thought of Commodore Sloat closing is heartbreaking and I can imagine that many parents in SFUSD feel that way about their children's school, not to mention the staff that would be affected.”

The first round of community sessions starts on March 30 for Sheridan Elementary School and Willie Brown Middle School. In addition, SFUSD is hosting a virtual town hall on March 28.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/sfusd-neighborhood-meeting/
d13b8ea2-8562-4f0e-b232-51002f374e7d,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 23, 2024, 3:01 PM",Mark Farrell’s pitch to voters? ‘Common sense.’,,"Three times within an hour, San Francisco mayoral hopeful Mark Farrell called on voters to use “common sense” to decide on their stance on city issues. 

“San Francisco is moving away from just being ideological, this left and right, progressive and moderate,” Farrell said last night, to a sold-out crowd at Manny’s cafe in conversation with Mission Local’s managing editor, Joe Eskenazi. “Let’s just have common sense again.”

Farrell, like Daniel Lurie and Ahsha Safaí in earlier conversations, expressed his frustration with the city’s status quo, and strived to differentiate himself from the rest of the field, stacked with candidates who will be making their appeals to the same set of moderate voters. In particular, he proposed to remove all large homeless encampments in six months, wean downtown San Francisco off of its dependence on the tech industry, increase police staffing levels and open 24/7 clinics for drug users. 

But, like others, he contrasted the San Francisco of today with earlier, better times. In the old days, if you told someone you were from San Francisco, said the 50-year-old San Francisco native, “It was met with a sense of awe, a sense of wonderment, even envy. And today you get, ‘Are you okay?’”

As he sees it, San Francisco’s public safety, street conditions and economy have never been worse. And that’s mostly due to a “plain and simply failed leadership,” said Farrell. San Francisco used to have more than 2,300 police officers when Ed Lee was the mayor and Farrell was a supervisor, he said. The same number now stands at 1,857, according to the police department. Farrell mentioned former District Attorney Chesa Boudin for demoralizing the police department. 

“Since I left office, our population has declined,”  he said. “So inherently, crime should decline because of that on its face.”

The crime rate, however, did decline. San Francisco saw fewer cases of both property crimes and violent crimes in 2023 than 2018, the year Farrell left office. 

“We need to have law enforcement in San Francisco, just on principle, to create a civil society, to make sure there is deterrent,” he said. “In San Francisco, at times in the past, that has been foreign. But I think it’s just common sense that needs to be brought back.”

Farrell argued that his 7.5 years at City Hall — seven years as District 2 supervisor and six months as mayor after Ed Lee died — had equipped him with “a consistent track record” that voters could predict his performance in office. 

To him, Mayor London Breed’s track record has been inconsistent on a number of issues. Regarding the abandoned downtown, he said Breed’s ideas make the city look disorganized: “What we heard was week one, we’re going to build science labs. Week two, we’re going to build housing. Week three, it was a U.C. campus, and then it became a soccer stadium.” 

Michael Petrelis, who is running for District 9 supervisor, disrupted the conversation early on from outside the cafe, holding a sign that read “Ban cars now!” and interjecting frequently. He blared criticisms of Farrell from a bullhorn, but the volume on the speakers’ microphones was turned up, and Petrelis left after some 20 minutes. (We reported earlier that Petrelis attempted to shut down the event and left because he was tired. Petrelis wrote in an email, “My goal was not to stop the conversation and my cameraman had to leave because he had a date. I didn’t leave because I was tired.”

Macy’s recent closure announcement “caught the mayor’s office off guard, and City Hall off guard,” said Farrell, who noted similar situations also happened with Nordstrom and the San Francisco Centre’s closure. 

Farrell said Breed’s office does not have relationships with the city’s largest tenants, largest building owners and the equity and debt behind them. This situation wouldn’t have happened if he were mayor, he said. He wouldn’t have been blindsided, and would’ve brought everyone together and worked out a solution comprehensively, he said. 

As for plans for a downtown recovery, Farrell said he would first focus on addressing public safety and street conditions, to create an environment where employers and employees would be willing to come back.

“Diversification” was his diagnosis for downtown in the long term. “You know, we were over-reliant on the tech industry,” said Farrell. 

“To the point where everyone wore the same vest,” noted Eskenazi.

“I’m glad I didn’t wear mine tonight,” said Farrell, who sported a black suit and white button-down. He noted that the tech industry’s tendency to work from home has turned San Francisco’s downtown into a veritable ghost town. 

How would the public sector fix things that it neither created nor broke? Eskenazi asked.

The power of tax incentives, Farrell answered. In 2011, Mayor Lee and the Board of Supervisors, including Farrell, managed to use tax breaks to attract Twitter to revitalize mid-Market. “But it didn’t work. We learned our lessons as well,” he said. 

Twitter brought a Silicon Valley model campus to San Francisco, having an in-house gym, an in-house cafe and even in-house dry cleaning, which prevented the surrounding neighborhoods from benefiting much, he said. “If we do this again, we have to do it in a much different, much smarter way,” he said. 

“I think unless we’re aggressive about [reviving downtown], we’re going to lose downtown forever in a potential way,” he said. 

Farrell also wants cars back on Market Street. “Let’s just have common sense again,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to admit that taking cars off Market Street, it’s not a panacea.”

“Market Street hasn’t been safer, statistically, since we took cars off Market Street,” Farrell said. 

Contrasting Farrell’s citation of statistics regarding street safety — but not crime, in which people “feel” less safe in spite of statistically lower levels, Eskenazi quipped “But I feel safer.” 

As for this week’s tragic car collision at West Portal which killed a family of four, Farrell said the lesson he drew was that the city should be “very granular” about every single intersection. He said he learned from friends who live in West Portal that, prior to the accident, the local community had sent multiple emails to the city saying it was a dangerous intersection, emails that went unheeded.

When asked who he would fire as mayor, Farrell mentioned the head of SFMTA, Jeffrey Tumlin, to promote public transportation, bicycling and pedestrian safety. In particular, he mentioned SFMTA’s L Taraval Project. “You tore up the street. You took away every single parking spot in the name of increasing the time or decreasing the time it will take for a trolley to get down the road and down. But you know what you’re also doing? Killing. You’re killing a lot of small businesses,” he said. 

And Police Chief Bill Scott, whom Farrell called “a very good man” who had simply been in the position too long. “At the end of the day, the average tenure of a police chief in the U.S. is three years, and he has been here for almost eight,” Farrell said. 

Farrell also intends to back city charter reform on November’s ballot, to guarantee the mayor always has the power to fire or hire department heads in a “plain and simple” way. This week, Farrell created a political action committee to push two ballot measures that would do just that, while also allowing the mayoral candidate to seek unlimited campaign donations to ostensibly back those ballot measures.

Asked whether he would support Breed’s recent veto of Board President Aaron Peskin’s legislation limiting density in areas of his district, Farrell said he would.

“I need you to speak loudly so the people in District 2 can hear you,” Eskenazi said. Would they want 270-foot high-rises in their neighborhoods? 

It’s not about housing, but about “sloppy legislation” inside City Hall, said Farrell. “We had last summer’s density increases that everyone agreed upon. We come a few months later and say, ‘Whoops, I didn’t mean that we’re going to density decrease.’”

Farrell sought to sidestep a pro-housing or anti-housing characterization, falling back on his “common sense” pitch.

“Where is this common sense, once again?” said Farrell. “This gets back to the YIMBY, NIMBY, different sides of the aisle, where it’s just a zero-sum game and somebody has to win. Unless you’re fully with us, you’re off the boat.”

“I do not believe that we need to upzone every single neighborhood in San Francisco,” he added, saying it is the wrong approach. “As is the approach to say that we’re not going to build anywhere in San Francisco. We can do it in a very smart manner.”

Farrell also promised to take out all the large homeless encampments in six months by offering residents shelter, which he did as mayor in 2018, he said. 

He suggested having clinics for substance use care open 24/7. “We have to capture [drug users] when they’re willing to make a different decision. And to give them a chance for a better life,” he said.

And, on Day One, he would audit all of the San Francisco nonprofits working on homelessness, because the city is funding a large amount of overlapping services, he said. There could be as many as nine city departments that fund homeless spending, he said. “Many fund the same nonprofit, but don’t realize that they’re doing it, and have different metrics for how they’re measuring success.”

Asked which past mayor he would seek to emulate, Farrell pointed to traits of several different city leaders. Farrell appreciated former Mayor Willie Brown’s ability to simply get things done, he said, and Gavin Newsom’s bold approach to politics and policy. He aspired to Ed Lee’s patience and Dianne Feinstein’s genuine love of San Francisco. 

He chose not to answer who his ranked-choice alliance would be, saying it was premature, but acknowledged that it would be a part of any mayoral candidate’s strategy. 

If elected, Farrell, who was the longest-serving Board of Supervisors budget chair in San Francisco’s history, will also be one of the first — if not the first — mayors of a major American city who is a venture capitalist. His finance background, he said, would be “super relevant” to the fate of San Francisco, a city that has a projected budget deficit of $728 million in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, and a 36 percent office-vacancy rate. 

“It is amazing to me that what City Hall is turning to is just a blame game … No one’s willing to take leadership and accountability,” he said. “We need that back in San Francisco if we’re going to bring our city back.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mark-farrells-common-sense/
1c12aa8f-8543-448a-a88a-3fbdc703aed2,news,mission,RESTAURANT REVIEWS,MARIA C. ASCARRUNZ,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:40 AM","Review: Foliage, Precita Park spot offering prix fixe menu, can do better",,"Foliage opened in October 2023 in the space vacated by Michelin-starred Marlena, which has since moved to Japantown as the already acclaimed Adams 7 — Japantown’s gain, our loss. 

Foliage owners Stephane Roulland and Julia Indovina brought in Chef Mo Béjar to the beautiful corner space by Precita Park. When my editor asked me to review the new restaurant at their publicist’s request, I was salivating at the prospect of trying another somewhat affordable ($75) prix-fixe menu in the area. Béjar hails from the Central Valley, and his dishes have the requisite farm-to-table, sustainable and beautiful aesthetic, and they sounded interesting and fresh, with a few culinary twists and turns. 

We started out with the house-made milk bread with cultured butter. The other option was the bread with a spiced salt and Spanish jamón, but we went for the basic. 

This gorgeous golden orb came to the table, warm and inviting, with a very generous slab of butter, gleaming with crystals of crunchy salt. Plenty for us to have two wedges apiece, the interior was fluffy and yeasty, and gave us high hopes for the rest of the meal. Besides, who ever gives you enough butter with your bread? 

The prix-fixe menu at Foliage offers two options per course, plus some optional add-ons. We decided to get each of the options, so that we would get to taste everything.

First course: Amberjack crudo with lacto-fermented pineapple, banana, macadamia nuts, and thinly sliced kohlrabi. 

The vegetarian option: Avocado with essentially the same ingredients.

Both had a little funk, with an inexplicable paprika oil at the bottom of the bowls. The amberjack was lovely, but it was an odd combination of flavors; banana and fish connote a somewhat Caribbean vibe, but it didn’t really work for us. We were also a bit puzzled about the choice to take the same ingredients and simply substitute avocado for the protein. It seemed to me that here was a perfect, missed opportunity to make a wholly different, inventive vegetarian option. While we weren’t thrilled with the amberjack dish, the vegetarian option was lackluster. 

Second course: Shrimp toast and ricotta gnocchi.

Beautiful dishes, both. The Foliage shrimp toast was wonderful; super crispy, light, highly spiced, with a Sichuan peppercorn aioli, and perfectly cooked shrimp. I’d get it again (and, in fact, I did). Our only quibble was the Osetra caviar was wasted on this. You literally could not taste it with everything else going on.

The gnocchi dish came with a lovely gorgonzola sauce, pooled under beautifully wilted and browned sweet cabbage, topped with fried sage and toasted nuts. Unfortunately, the cabbage was the best thing on the plate; the ricotta gnocchi themselves were severely tough and dense. We found them inedible, and when the runner eventually came around to ask if he could take the plate (without asking why the dish was untouched), I told him that the gnocchi were very hard. He apologized profusely and said he would tell the chef. When he returned, he informed us the chef admitted that they were usually softer, and asked if we wanted him to try making them again, or did we want another shrimp toast? Perhaps we should have taken him up on the offer for a re-do, but we took the safe-bet toast. My question is: How does that go out to a table? And were others eating those heavy gnocchi without complaint?

At that point, the courses seemed to have slowed down. I’d finished a glass of Cremant bubbly, and asked the runner for the list so I could order a glass of wine. He misheard me, and brought another glass of the same sparkling wine. He apologized, and began to take it back, but my sister said she would just take it so it wouldn’t go to waste. She hadn’t planned on having alcohol with dinner. I ordered a very good cabernet.

Next came our entrée courses. The options were local cod over sweet potato puree with fava greens and charred leeks, or roasted cauliflower with a vadouvan crema for the vegetarian dish. Or, for an additional $15, a coulotte steak (described by our server as “the best cut, the top of the sirloin.”) with mole, chayote, citrus, and chocolate jus. Sold! We ordered the fish and the steak.

The cod was a bit on the small side, slightly overdone, the skin could have been a little crisper for my taste, but overall had good flavor. The underlying sweet potato puree and leeks were good, the garum (an ancient Roman fish sauce) very subtle. I was busy eating my portion of the fish before switching off with my sister, so I didn’t notice she was having trouble with the steak.

When they first put the dish on the table, I asked if the thin brown sauce underneath the steak was the mole, and our runner said no, that’s the chocolate jus. A minute later, the chef himself came by with an extra little ramekin of the orange mole, which had been hiding under the chayote. A nice gesture, though I hadn’t asked for more; I just hadn’t seen it on the plate. We chatted with Chef Béjar a few minutes, asked where he’d cooked before, wished him well. 

The steak was rare (which we both like), and I finally noticed my sister sawing away at the meat for an interminable amount of time. She looked at me in disbelief. “You need to cut this into really small pieces, or you won’t be able to chew it.” I tried my hand at it and, sure enough, it took at least 10 seconds to hack free a tiny piece, and then another 10 to chew it until it was soft enough to swallow. Again, we just could not eat it. The Foliage mole itself was — sorry, the only word I can think of is strange — citrusy, and unlike any other mole I’d ever had. The chayote was hard and flavorless. Our server finally came by and asked us how we were enjoying the course as she stared at the full plate. I demonstrated how hard it was to cut through the meat. She replied, “Yes, because it’s a very chewy cut.” Before I could show my amazement at this explanation, she quickly asked if she should take it away and I said “yes, please.”

In all the time I’ve been reviewing for Mission Local, I really can’t remember sending a dish back, much less two in one meal. By this point, we were looking around at the quite full restaurant and wondering if it was just us? We’re normally not that picky (in fact, I often get accused of liking everything indiscriminately), and we don’t relish making a scene. It was baffling, as no one else seemed to be having an issue, but seemed to be enjoying their meals thoroughly. 

Dessert course: One was a mango semifreddo with tuile crumbles, a little mango jelly, and mint. 

“Semifreddo” means “partially frozen.” The ice cream here, unfortunately, was a solid disk, and we had to wait a bit for it to soften. It tasted fine, however; very subtly mango flavored. 

The other dessert was a white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries. The panna cotta was nicely creamy and, thankfully, not too sweet. All in all, there was nothing wrong with the desserts; they were simply unremarkable.

And the perfect ending to our meal? As I reached for the bill, my hand hit my glass which still had some wine in it — only my second glass of the evening, mind you — and in dramatic fashion knocked it onto the table, smashing it loudly, flinging wine and bits of glass everywhere. A shard actually drew blood from my sister’s hand. Mortified, I now saw myself through the eyes of our servers and chef: “Oh, was that the drunk woman who complained about everything?” I apologized over and over, all were gracious, mopping up the mess and making light of the incident. The Foliage staff handled it with class and kindness.

They also graciously took the $15 steak off our bill without my asking, charged us for the wine that was a mistake (which, yes, we’d drank), and handed us a bill for close to $250. 

It truly pains me to write a review like this. Anyone can make a mistake; a bad dish can happen to any kitchen, but don’t send it out. If a cut of beef is so chewy, cook it some other way. The deficiencies in the dishes we disliked were basic errors in execution. I know it is an excruciatingly difficult thing to open, run, and maintain a restaurant for any length of time, in this city, or anywhere. What a feather in Chef Béjar’s cap to have opened in this lovely space, with a ready-made clientele mourning the loss of their beloved Marlena. (NB: I never told anyone at the restaurant that I was reviewing that night, even though we’d been asked to do so.)

I’m hoping this was simply an anomaly, as I’m rooting for Chef Béjar to achieve success in that space, and for Foliage to become a neighborhood mainstay, as I’m sure the Precita Park community is hoping as well.

The mural, located next to the Valero gas station at Jules Avenue, was created by San Francisco-based artist and former Ingleside resident Rhonel Roberts and depicts his cherished memory of living in the neighborhood.

The vintage postcard-style mural highlights a portion of Ingleside’s residential hillside going downhill, filled with vibrant-colored mid-century modern homes. In addition to its radiant color palette, it shows turquoise and white rays and the word “Ingleside” to help draw the viewer’s eyes to the center.

“I just want people to know that they’re seen,” Roberts said. “They matter. They’re recognized and they can be celebrated.”

The mural was funded as part of the Civic Joy Fund’s Adopt-A-Block project, which is investing $100,000 into four blocks around the city to provide physical improvements.

“It’s possibly the beginning of Ingleside being able to create greater density of our art and our beauty and individual landmarks in physical items that celebrate the beauty of our neighborhood,” said Caleb Hilladakis, the fund’s special project assistant.

This project is also a part of several other beautification projects to the neighborhood with help from the fund over the last year including string light installations and the recent “Ingleside Landmarks” mural on the side of Walgreens.

The Ocean Avenue Association was consulted on this project for design input, the association’s Small Business and Marketing Manager Rosendo Betancourt said.

The Civic Joy Fund also partnered with Mark Bonsignore, owner of Urban + Environmental Design, who said the cost for the mural was $12,000.

“It’s a safe neighborhood but that gas station and that [dim] light doesn’t really give off inviting vibes so what we did was add brightness,” Bonsignore said.

The design was printed by Mass Factor Media, a graphic printing and installation business in Oakland, on Avery Dennison Graphic Solutions' hi-tack MPI 1106 cast vinyl and was sealed with lamination for protection from the elements.

Due to time, Roberts and Mass Factor Media owner Mark LeTang opted to apply the mural using vinyl rather than hand painting it. Roberts and LeTang spent two days fitting the 10-panel mural to the shiplap-textured wall.

“I hope people talk about it,” LeTang said. “I hope people really credit the artist. San Francisco, right now, really needs a lot of attention. They really need art. They really need creatives to get us through this period of time.”",https://www.inglesidelight.com/ingleside-postcard-mural-rhonel-roberts/

SFMTA Transportation Planner Shannon Hake presented the potential camera locations and process to the New Mission Terrace Improvement Association’s regular meeting at Ingleside Police Station. SFMTA’s plan was released on March 14 as part of the five-year pilot program allowed by the passage of Assembly Bill 645. Six cities, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, will use automated speed cameras to capture images of rear license plates of vehicles that go over the speed limit to penalize motorists in a bid to improve safety.

“We are anticipating that speed safety cameras are an important part of an overall what can be done on a street but not the only thing,” Hake said. “We believe that they're going to be most effective with engineering changes as well that change the roadway layout or change how fast you can drive on a street.”

San Francisco will be allotted 33 cameras to be placed around the city. The number is determined by the city’s population. The SFMTA plans to place the cameras in corridors on the high-injury networks, streets where collisions happen the most frequently. Installations are expected to start in the summer.

Six speed cameras are proposed for Ingleside and nearby neighborhoods: Ocean Avenue from Friday Kahlo Way to Howth Street, San Jose Avenue from Santa Ynez Avenue to Ocean Avenue, Alemany Boulevard from Farragut Avenue to Naglee Avenue, Mission Street from Ottawa Avenue to Allison Street, Geneva Avenue from Prague Street to Brookdale Avenue and Monterey Boulevard from Edna Street to Congo Street.

“I think the ones that we ended up recommending are the ones that are definitely the strongest because I think this is an opportunity for us to change policy not only in San Francisco but in California,” Hake said.

Pedestrian and road safety is on NMTIA members’ minds following recent pedestrian fatalities by motor vehicles at the Alemany Boulevard and Rousseau Street intersection in February and the March 16 crash that killed three people beside West Portal Station on Saturday.

NMTIA recently welcomed a new traffic light at Alemany Boulevard and Theresa Street with other neighbors and District 11 Supervisor Ahsha Safaí on Feb. 24.

“That’s why the speed cameras, more than anything, are so important to pedestrian and people’s lives because every five to ten miles [per hour] you go up, the probability of death goes up dramatically,” Safaí said.

Several attendees asked about the cost of this project and how it would work for those caught speeding. Hake said it would be funded through the transportation agency’s operating budget to get a camera vendor and any revenue that is earned will initially go toward covering program costs with any additional income going towards traffic calming improvements.

Offenders would be charged a penalty at a cost of $50 to $500 depending on how many mph over the speed limit they drive. Violations would also be issued as civil penalties and treated more like tollbooth charges with the ticket going to the individual on the vehicle's registration.

Sam Thomas, who lives on San Jose Avenue, said a speed camera on Alemany Boulevard is “super important.”

“Alemany is super dangerous,” Thomas said. “We just had a neighbor who died on Cotter. It’s terrible. Alemany is a whole different beast.”

The speed camera proposal will go to the SFMTA Board of Directors in April and then on to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in June.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/speed-camera-installation-meeting/

The Ocean Avenue Association, a nonprofit tasked with cleaning and beautifying Ingleside’s stretch of Ocean Avenue, partnered with Climate Action Now California, a nonprofit that works to increase green infrastructure investments and programs throughout San Francisco, to plant greenery on Ocean Avenue between Miramar and Lee avenues earlier this month. Despite the bad weather, they had two volunteers participate and were able to plant five trees and landscape three areas.

“The event went great,” OAA’s Deputy Director Gabe Cory said. “It was a pleasure working with Climate Action Now to beautify three different areas along Ocean Avenue with trees and sidewalk gardens.”

The three landscaped areas were fitted with Catalina Ironwood trees and sidewalk gardens with flowers like coffee berry, manzanita, sage, California rye, silk tassel, South African lilies and more. The founding director of Climate Action Now, Markos Major, said they sourced the greenery from wholesale nurseries such as Pacific Nursery and Devil Mountain Wholesale Nursery.

Funding for this project also came from the Civic Joy Fund, a nonprofit spending $2 million to put some magic back into San Francisco’s commercial corridors following the slow recovery from the pandemic, Cory said.

Three trees and one sidewalk garden were placed on the block in front of The Fate Teahouse between Brighton and Lee avenues. One tree and a 20-25’ sidewalk garden were planted near the San Francisco Public Library’s Ingleside Branch. One tree and sidewalk garden were planted on Miramar Avenue toward the Westwood Park entrance.

“We hope this to be the beginning of a partnership with Ocean Avenue,” Major said. “There’s so much work to be done in our city. Increasing permeability, removing pavement and planting gardens is one of the greatest ways to support a healthy climate.”

This project is among the first of many, Cory said, with the next round of planting planned for the summer. Climate Action Now has also worked with nearby neighborhood organizations such as the Friends of Lakeside Village on similar volunteer opportunities. Major also said they are in talks with Java On Ocean to partner for their next neighborhood project.

“Something as small as planting a few trees and sidewalk gardens can make a big difference on the look and feel of a street,” Cory said. “We hope the community enjoys these new additions and they add more beauty to Ocean Avenue.”",https://www.inglesidelight.com/ingleside-ocean-avenue-trees-landscaping/

The family — Matilde Ramos Pinto, Diego Cardoso de Oliveira and their two young children — were standing at the bus stop at Ulloa Street and Lenox Way. It was the day of their wedding anniversary, and they were waiting for the bus to go to the zoo. 

The driver, Mary Fong Lau, 78, was driving the wrong way down Ulloa Street. She was arrested the following day, and police are still investigating the incident. She has not been charged, and is cooperating with investigators. 

It is a devastating incident, and one that prompts our question for this week’s candidates: How can San Francisco prevent this kind of accident from happening again? 

For Boschetto, City Hall and Vision Zero — the city’s 2014 plan to eliminate all traffic deaths within a decade — have been ineffective in addressing public safety. He promised that, as supervisor, he would work with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to identify all danger zones in District 7 and “take precautions to make sure we avoid tragedies like this,” though, in 100 words, he did not specify exactly how. 

The city has failed in its Vision Zero goal: Fatal collisions have increased since 2014, and 2022 saw the most traffic deaths in San Francisco since 2007.

For Martin-Pinto, it is “important to let the facts come out in this case” before proposing solutions, though he did suggest changing the configuration of bus stops and enforcing traffic regulations. Likewise, the two other candidates noted that lack of traffic enforcement is an issue. 

Traffic enforcement has collapsed across San Francisco since 2014, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Police officers are issuing a small fraction of the citations they did 10 years ago, leading supervisors to hold pointed inquiries into the problem last year. 

Melgar, for her part, pointed to both enforcement and slowing down cars, alongside physical protective infrastructure like bollards. She also went further by suggesting that certain areas around public transportation hubs should be fully pedestrianized and closed to cars altogether. 

Their answers are below, but I also wanted to let you know that I will be in your district on Monday, March 25 at 1 p.m. at Ballast Coffee (329 West Portal Ave.). I’ll be around for an hour, and then in the district, talking to residents and businesses. Check back here to see where I will be next.

Here's What To Know,"Now that the scaffolding is down and the mural is ready to be christened, here’s what to know about it and its contents.","The scaffolding has come down from Ingleside’s huge new mural.

Local artist Neil Ballard, with assistance from fellow artist Nathaniel Bice, completed an enormous mural on the side of the neighborhood’s Walgreens. And an unveiling ceremony is scheduled for Saturday, March, 16 at 1:30 p.m.

“This was accomplished due to the desire on [store manager Michael] Rong’s part to solve a problem and at the same time, beautify the community,” said Jen Cotto, a spokesperson for Walgreens.

The project, which Ballard named ""Ingleside Landmarks,"" was paid through the Civic Joy Fund, a nonprofit spending $2 million to put some magic back into San Francisco’s commercial corridors following the slow recovery from the pandemic. As part of the fund’s Adopt-A-Block project, $100,000 is being poured into improving one block of Ocean Avenue. Three other blocks in the city also get $100,000 each.

Ingleside’s adopted block is Ocean Avenue between Jules and Miramar avenues. The mural cost $25,000, according to Caleb Hilladakis, the fund’s special projects assistant.

“Growing up off Ocean, I had been familiar with Neil's work for a handful of years,” Hilladakis said. “I was excited by the chance to work with him and have been blown away by how he captured the beauty of our neighborhood.”

The fund is working with the Ocean Avenue Association, a nonprofit tasked with cleaning and beautifying Ingleside’s stretch of Ocean Avenue. Hilladakis said they’ve given the association $16,000 so far. Ten thousand dollars went to installing string lights and $6,000 went to landscaping.

The mural depicts some of Ingleside’s historic landmarks. Here’s the rundown:

El Rey Theatre: The Timothy Pflueger-designed Art Deco movie palace.

Ingleside Terraces Sundial: At one time, it was the city’s largest sundial. Fun fact: It was dedicated at night.

St. Emydius Catholic Church: St. Emydius is the patron saint of earthquake survivors.

City College of San Francisco’s Science Hall: A Timothy Pflueger masterwork outfitted with fine Public Works Administration art. Take a tour!

K Ingleside Streetcar: The K Line was built for the opening of the Ingleside Racetrack in 1895.

Beep’s Burgers' neon sign: The iconic burger stand opened in 1962 during the burgeoning space race.

Palms and Monterey Cyprus: The neighborhood’s signature flora are featured prominently. (FYI: Palms are technically trees.)

Part of the resolution includes urging city departments to spend more outreach and advertising dollars on community and ethnic news media outlets rather than using third-party vendors — a recommendation from a report released by California Common Cause, a nonpartisan policy and advocacy organization.

“Democracy depends on robust independent journalism, and robust independent journalism depends on thriving community- and neighborhood-centered news outlets,” said Supervisor Matt Dorsey in a news release. Dorsey was the main sponsor of the resolution.

“With the San Francisco Board of Supervisors’ passage of this resolution today, we’re expanding on our city’s commitment to its diverse communities by supporting the diverse community-based journalism that’s part of it,” Dorsey added.

The report titled “Local Voices on Local News: Community Perspectives and Policy Recommendations for Strengthening San Francisco’s Journalism Ecosystem” released in February looked at the community and ethnic journalism community landscape and held focus groups in different languages (English, Chinese Spanish and Tagalog) for several months with San Franciso residents to find what their needs are in reading local news.

“Local news is critical to our democracy, and we know that San Franciscans are hungry for more,” said Maya Chupkov, media and democracy program manager at California Common Cause in a news release.

One of the recommendations in the report was the idea of city departments shifting some of the advertising money they spend to independent media publishers that would help provide resources for community and ethnic media news outlets to stay afloat.

The report said community journalism news media outlets play a critical role in the media landscape as they report and cover news stories in the community and neighborhoods that are not necessarily the main focus of major news outlets in San Francisco.

“This investment in local media has proven successful in New York and Chicago, and will likewise ensure that our city government supports and communicates directly and effectively with readers of underserved ethnic and community media,” said Michael Yamashita in a news release, who is the publisher of the Bay Area Reporter newspaper.

At the request of Dorsey, the Budget and Legislative Analyst released a report last December to provide options for creating a program to direct more advertising spending to these types of outlets. The BLA report said 98 media outlets were operating in the city, but only seven publications were approved by the Board of Supervisors for an advertising contract to publish legally required notices for fiscal year 2023-24.

The BLA report looked at other cities that have programs where advertising and outreach expenditures go to community news outlets. Cities, namely New York, have codified into law that at least 50% of all print and digital advertising — excluding legally required notices — be spent in community and ethnic media outlets. A list of media outlets was compiled and an office within the mayor’s office was created to monitor the program.

The BLA gave city officials policy considerations if they were to pursue such a program like New York, including a vetted directory of community and ethnic news outlets and setting a mandated percentage of advertising that would go towards these news outlets. Additionally, the BLA stated the city would need to clearly define what is considered advertising, establish a system to track how spending will be tracked and reported and determine which community and ethnic media outlets can qualify as a city vendor.

San Francisco State University Journalism Department Chair Jesse Garnier said there should also be other criteria established to prevent political interference if community and ethnic journalism outlets were to receive money from the city government. The journalism department is acting as a local independent monitor to help with the city’s plan to prioritize advertising dollars to ethnic media outlets and independent news publishers.

The Bay Area Independent Community Media Coalition, which is being led by California Common Cause and includes several community and bilingual publications in print and online in the city, is advocating for a policy solution that would increase the amount of advertising the city spends in local community and ethnic media outlets. The Ingleside Light is a participant, and — despite publishing bonafide journalism for an eager hyperlocal every week — it cannot participate in the city’s outreach advertising because the rules have not been modernized for the digital age.

“We are energized to work with the city, ethnic and multilingual media outlets, and local community publishers to carry out recommendations from the report. This should help ensure city messaging on programs reach all residents, in all communities, through known and trusted outlets,” Garnier said.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/san-francisco-lawmakers-support-community-media/

Each artist was given free rein to create something that would express the culture and character of Ingleside through a project of the Ocean Avenue Association.

“I made a fresh painting that I felt represented Ingleside in my memories and my nostalgia and my viewpoint but also try to make it a little bit universal to the neighbors and people that transverse Ocean Avenue,” Purohit said.

Purohit, who’s created many paintings of the neighborhood’s streets, also wanted to pay homage to three entities in Ingleside that have supported his art practice in monumental ways and chose to focus on the corner of Plymouth Avenue and Ocean Avenue looking toward Go Go 7, Ocean Ale House, Ingleside Presbyterian Church and K Ingleside light rail streetcars during sunset. He used shades of blue, green, red and yellow to depict the scene.

For Smith, a student at the City College of San Francisco studying digital art, designing something for this project required stepping outside her comfort zone and creating digital art pieces using the Adobe Creative Suite to fit the printing parameters best. She already has painted work displayed in the neighborhood: the logo inside WestWood Produce.

“I wanted to capture just the fun-ness that I see around Ocean Avenue,” Smith said. “There's a lot of kids who hang out there. A lot of people go to restaurants and I feel like a lot of times I see a nice, playful vibe. A welcoming neighborhood that I like to be a part of so I tried to design something that was kind of light hearted.”

Smith created a design for the banners with a two-part oceanic display of various fish from the ocean like clownfish and hammerhead sharks on a light pink backdrop and iridescent-like bubbles.

Ciccio Boles, who was not available to be interviewed, created a light blue banner with icons of the sun, waves, palm trees and the words “Ocean Ave” in his unique style.

The Ocean Avenue Association, a nonprofit tasked with cleaning and beautifying Ingleside’s stretch of Ocean Avenue, started placing 50 vertical banners, from Fairfield Way to Harold Avenue a few weeks ago. It’s the second time it has placed banners featuring local artists along the avenue. The first time was under a program called ""Arts Alive Ingleside.""

The installation was originally projected for around the first week of February but OAA’s Small Business and Marketing Manager Rosendo Betancourt said the delay was due to the weather. The banners are another art project courtesy of the association, joining the mural on the neighborhood’s Walgreens.

“This project was in the 'talks' phase when I joined the organization,” Betancourt said. “The present board then was enthusiastic about getting banners in the district so I wanted to accomplish the task. Due to scheduling conflicts, pole reservations and other city campaigns, we could only secure the banners now but we're excited things are coming to fruition.”

San Francisco-based flag and banner company A3 Visuals was hired to produce the printed designs costing the association $9,000.

The association is committed to building the “vibrancy and safety of the retail district.”

“We hope these banners introduce a new yet familiar feeling of expression and culture to the already close-knit community of Ocean Avenue,” Betancourt said.

The banner installation is expected to be completed by late March.

The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors approved Tuesday the $34.2 million K Ingleside Rapid Project that will extend boarding islands to ensure passengers can safely get on and off trains as well as expand capacity on the rail line by speeding it up on the street, said transportation agency planner Anna Harkman. Additionally, the transit-only lanes and safety improvements for pedestrians will be included.

Staff is looking into the feasibility of installing temporary concrete boarding islands at the eight transit stop locations as part of the quick-build construction phase of the project this spring or summer, Harkman said.

If feasible, the transportation agency wants to allow riders to begin using the second-car train sooner rather than later, said Michael Rhodes, a transit priority manager.

The K, which carries about 13,000 passengers a day, does not currently allow two-car train boarding between West Portal and Balboa Park stations because several boarding islands on Ocean Avenue cannot accommodate two-car trains. Train operators spend time at West Portal station to ensure passengers are no longer in the second-car train before locking the doors.

To allow two-car train boarding, boarding islands will be extended at the following stops on Ocean Avenue in each direction for a total of eight boarding island extensions:

Harkman said there will be a reduction of 12 parking spaces along the project corridor to accommodate the new boarding islands. She added that the agency restored some parking by changing one block of Dorado Terrace from parallel to angled parking.

Additionally, parking spaces will return once two stops there are eliminated.

The project will remove the transit stops at Westgate Drive and Cerritos Avenue to improve the speed of the K. Harkman said the stops had low ridership and that the stop at Aptos Avenue was one block away.

Another effort to speed up the K is to install a red transit-only lanes on Ocean Avenue between Junipero Serra Boulevard and Frida Kahlo Way (eastbound) and between Geneve Avenue and Junipero Serra Boulevard (westbound).

Harkman said the project will restrict left turns at transit stop locations to prevent traffic from queueing and delaying the trains. The following intersections will have left turn restrictions in the eastbound direction:

In the westbound direction, the following intersections will have left turn restrictions:

Additionally, new left turn signals will be installed at Cerritos Avenue (westbound), Brighton Avenue (eastbound) and Plymouth Avenue (westbound).

The transportation agency will install sidewalk extensions on Ocean Avenue at San Benito Avenue, Westgate Drive/Cerritos Avenue, Manor Drive and Granada Avenue. Officials said the extensions will increase the visibility of pedestrians crossing the intersections and reduce the distance it takes to cross the street.

Flashing beacons will be installed at the intersections of San Benito Avenue, Manor Drive and Granada Avenue to improve the visibility of pedestrian crossings for drivers. The crosswalks at those intersections would be consolidated or relocated to direct pedestrians to intersections that are safer to cross.

The Ingleside Merchants Association requested more improvements such as parklets but they were not included.

The transportation agency anticipates implementing some of the elements this spring or summer as part of a quick-build phase. The staff report said some of the elements include the possibility of temporary concrete boarding islands, transit-only lanes, turn restrictions and parking changes.

The detailed design phase of the permanent changes will occur between now and 2026 with construction of the project of the permanent changes taking place in in 2027 and lasting until 2028.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/k-ingleside-rapid-project-approved/

Parents and teachers, fearing the district was phasing out the K-8 model, immediately launched an advocacy effort, with around 100 of them showing up at two school district meetings to make impassioned pleas.  

Just as they were anxiously anticipating the worst news on March 22, when school budgets were due, they instead discovered that three of the four K-8s they advocated for dodged some or all of the proposed cuts.

San Francisco Community School, a K-8 in the Excelsior, was going to lose its only middle-school physical education teacher and a campus security position for the coming school year. Days after advocates participated in their second school district meeting on March 13, the district let them know that both positions would come back, according to Maia Piccagli, president of the school’s Parent Action Council.

She wasn’t quite sure exactly why, but thought it had something to do with their advocacy. “I felt amazing, I felt really excited. Honestly, I’ve done a lot of advocacy in my life, but I have rarely seen an immediate change,” she said. “It felt great to have had so many parents involved in making statements and having there be such a quick win afterwards.”

“We are happy to hear that SFUSD leadership is receiving and applying feedback,” said Frank Lara, executive vice president of United Educators of San Francisco, in a statement.

The school district, while emphasizing it is “committed to a transparent process for school staffing and budget allocation,” did not specify how the decision had been made.

SoMa’s Bessie Carmichael School PreK-8 Filipino Education Center also got what its parents and teachers advocated for: The reinstatement of one of the school’s two social workers, who the school district was going to cut. The good news came last Thursday morning — less than two days after the school board meeting, according to the school community. 

Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School’s parents and teachers advocated for seven teaching positions the district had put on the block.  

The community learned early last week that the school district would reinstate two of their campus security positions, according to principal Claudia Delarios-Moran, who remains uncertain of the reason. These are necessary positions for the school, parents and teachers said, which the school had planned to hire at its own expense in the coming school year.

While the school district declined to add back the seven teaching positions, the money Buena Vista Horace Man will be able to save from spending on two campus security positions will be used to hire an extra teacher, reducing the casualties from seven to six. The school plans to hire a teacher to help with its fourth and fifth grades with the $157,000 saved, according to Delarios-Moran.

“I feel relieved, because it allows us to cut one less position,” said Delarios-Moran. “It gets us closer to where we were before in the first place.”

Twin Peaks’ Rooftop School TK-8 was not as fortunate. The school district informed the school in early March that it would lose one of its kindergarten positions. The school community made comments at the March 4 district advisory meeting, but didn’t show up at the following week’s school board meeting.

The position was not reinstated.

“They did not give us our kindergarten class back,” Rooftop Principal Darren Kawaii said last Friday. Kawaii also said he did not know how such decisions were made. 

They might “get it back” the year after, he said, “but it’s not confirmed.” 

Parents and teachers want assurances that “we will definitely get our kindergarten [teacher] back next year,” Kawaii added, but the district “won’t put it in writing whether it’s happening or not.”

The school district will start discussing school consolidation and closures this Thursday at a virtual town hall. At present, there are eight K-8 schools in San Francisco. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/some-k-8-schools-get-staffers-back-after-advocacy/
8f3acec6-8f84-4060-b299-89422411fcd0,news,mission,TROUBLE,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 25, 2024, 3:41 PM","Everett after-school worker remains in jail on rape charges, faces April trial",,"Warning: This story contains details about an alleged rape.

A judge today denied a motion to move Jeremy Rene Reyes from jail to home detention. The 20-year-old is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl earlier this month while he was employed as an after-school worker at Everett Middle School.

San Francisco Superior Court Judge Brian L. Ferrall also determined that the case will move forward to trial in early April.

Reyes, a worker with the nonprofit Mission Graduates’ after-school program, was arrested on March 5 at Everett Middle School following alleged improper contact with a student. He has been in custody since the arrest. 

On March 11, Reyes pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment. His maximum time in prison would be 14 years for the charges, which include three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, unlawful sexual intercourse and contact with a minor for sexual offense, according to court documents. 

A preliminary hearing was held today in Department 13 on the second floor of the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. Only Reyes’ mother and two other family members were in the courtroom’s audience. 

Reyes showed up in an orange jumpsuit and smiled when saw his family members. Throughout the two-hour hearing, Reyes repeatedly looked back to exchange glances with his family, especially his mother. At one point, Reyes mouthed “Love you” to his mother, who nodded in response. 

Deputy public defender Semuteh Freeman, who represents Reyes, said her client was comfortable participating in the hearing in English until a Spanish interpreter was available, saying that Reyes attended school and was educated in English from the age of 13. Two interpreters arrived in the second hour of the hearing and began interpreting the proceedings for Reyes.

Prosecutor Tanisha Gooch summoned two witnesses today: A San Francisco police officer and a sergeant, who both had first-hand information regarding the case. 

Officer Bryan Santan responded with his partner to the initial call at 12:45 p.m. on March 5 . He spoke with both Principal Alicia Blacknell and the alleged victim in the principal’s office at Everett Middle School. 

Santana said the victim and Reyes had known each other for several months before the alleged rape. They had kissed several times prior to March 5, but had not had a prior sexual relationship. While Santana continued to describe details of the alleged rape, Reyes shook his head. 

The purported victim took the bus to 16th and Mission streets, and then walked to meet Reyes at his nearby apartment, where the alleged rape took place, according to what Santana learned. The victim went to school after leaving Reyes’ apartment. Later, she felt physical pain and messaged Reyes. 

While being interviewed by Officer Santana on March 5, Blacknell identified Reyes as the “boyfriend” the victim had mentioned to her. Santana also identified Reyes in the courtroom today.

On March 5, the alleged victim told Santana, a certified Spanish translator, that her communication with Reyes was in Spanish. Santana saw several screenshots of the victim’s text messages, in Spanish, with Reyes. He told the court that the principal showed him the screenshots, and he saw them again later after obtaining the alleged victim’s phone. 

Both public defender Freeman and officer Santana agreed today that the resolution of the screenshots presented as exhibits in court today was so low that they were not legible. Still, Santana described what he could remember of the text messages.

He saw messages, including heart-shaped emojis, in Instagram DMs. He also recalled seeing the background photo of the alleged victim and Reyes’ WhatsApp exchange, which he said both sides could see: “The photo behind the entire series of texts that I was shown appeared to be the victim in a bra, wearing a small pair of jean shorts, looking away from the camera,” Santana said.

He also recalled the 12-year-old and Reyes calling each other pet names, saying “I love you,” and sending emojis of heart shapes and kisses. Once, Reyes even sent a Spanish sentence that could be roughly translated as “I wanna eat you up,” according to Santana.

But not every communique between the alleged victim and Reyes was so light. When the 12-year-old informed Reyes of being in pain after sexual intercourse, court documents list his responses as, “I’m sorry for being so hard” and “It only hurts the first time.” 

Santana acknowledged that neither he nor his partner turned their body camera on when they interviewed the 12-year-old on March 5, because of the police department’s policy on such cameras.

The second witness, Sergeant Daniel Kelly, was assigned the case on March 5, and spoke to the alleged victim about Reyes that evening. According to Kelly, she first met Reyes in late 2023, months before Reyes started working in the after-school program at Everett. When the alleged rape occurred on March 5, the victim was aware that Reyes was working at Everett, and that day was her first visit to Reyes’ apartment.

Kelly said the 12-year-old named three platforms on which she and Reyes had been communicating: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The girl’s phone has been turned over to the Crime Scene Investigation’s multimedia evidence unit.

Kelly also interviewed Reyes at Mission Station on March 5 and described Reyes as “calm.” Reyes said he taught art and coached sixth, seventh and eighth grade soccer at Everett. Reyes, who has a young child of his own, said he believed the victim was approximately 16 years old. He also said they were in love with each other; “that nobody has ever made him feel the way Jane Doe has,” said Kelly.  

He said “other female students [at Everett] had been essentially throwing themselves at him in a romantic sense, trying to give him hugs, trying to locate him on social media, messaging him [so much] that he had to regularly rebuff them,” said Kelly, recounting a conversation with Reyes.

Reyes acknowledged that he knew the victim was too young to have a sexual relationship with him, Kelly testified.

Kelly has had difficulty locating the address of the apartment where the alleged rape took place. According to the sergeant, Reyes provided one address, while Kelly and his team found another. 

The victim received medical care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. 

Reyes has been held in jail without bail. “The Defendant is an employee at a middle school, and thus surrounded by potential future victims,” the District Attorney’s Office argued in court documents. 

Attorneys of both parties and Judge Ferrall discussed whether Reyes should be moved to home detention, which Ferrall later dismissed, citing a public-safety risk.

Public defender Freeman said that, while Reyes did have a prior misdemeanor conviction in Richmond when he was 18, he has no other criminal record. Freeman said he has been shuttled in and out of foster care facilities since he was 13. Once Reyes was incarcerated, he lost the funds to pay rent for his apartment.

“I’m asking the court to consider the effect of prolonged incarceration on him. I do think that there are other non-carceral ways that the court can ensure public safety,” said Freeman. “I don’t think he’s a flight risk, both because we have a default here, but also because he has a child and mother, and he is co-parenting his child.”

Freeman also noted that the Central American Resource Center of Northern California has been working with Reyes and his mother on asylum claims.

“The people are concerned about public safety,” prosecutor Gooch argued. “He’s making comments that the young girls at this middle school who are in grades six through eight, are throwing themselves at him. He acknowledged during his interview that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that the victim was too young, but he did it anyway, because that’s how love works.”

“I agree he’s not a flight risk, but the risk to public safety, from the evidence I’ve heard, is severe,” said Ferrall, who said the material presented today in court was “extremely troubling.” 

“I can’t say that I’m comfortable with a less restrictive alternative of home detention, given what’s happened, and none of which would have been prevented by him being on electronic monitoring in his apartment,” he added, adding that the fact that the alleged rape happened at Reyes’ home rendered home detention a risk.

The judge also mentioned that Reyes has inflicted a potentially lifetime impact on the alleged victim. He also found Reyes’ comments of other girls at Everett throwing themselves at him troubling.

Ferrall discharged the felony charge of sodomy of a person under 18 for lack of evidence. Five felony charges remain.

After the decisions were made, Reyes broke into tears, lowering his head while his shoulders shook uncontrollably. Reyes’ mother, whose eyes were red from a morning of crying, called out words of encouragement to Reyes in Spanish. 

Ferrall also determined that he had seen enough evidence for Reyes to be held to answer, and the case will move forward to trial in early April.

The court has prohibited Reyes from coming within 150 yards of the victim or having electronic, written or telephonic contact with the victim, or contacting the victim through a third party other than the attorney.  ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/everett-after-school-worker-accused-of-rape-remains-incarcerated-troubling-material-emerges-in-court/

Welcome back to our “Meet the Candidates” series, in which District 9 supervisorial hopefuls respond to a question in 100 words or fewer. We’ve added an element this week: How long candidates have lived in the Mission. Next week, we will add endorsements and fundraising results. The aim of this series is to give voters as much information as possible.

For residents interested in talking about the issues most important to you, meet me today (Monday, March 25) at 1 p.m. at L’s cafe on 24th Street. I will be there until 2 p.m.

You can see all previous questions here.

Our week 11 question: We’re going back to the vending ban.

Earlier in this series, some of you wrote about favoring the ban and helping vendors in other ways. Some of you opposed the ban and want to see vending return under different terms. 

For those who support the ban, can you be more specific as to how you would help small businesses that perhaps are too small to rent their own space? The designated spaces on Mission Street and on 24th Street have not worked well for the vendors. What might you do differently? 

For those of you who oppose the ban, can you be more explicit about how vending can be regulated and monitored, knowing that an earlier effort to issue permits to legitimate vendors failed to prevent illegal vending? Many of the permitted vendors, for example, did not want to be at the plazas because of the chaotic atmosphere created by illegal vending.  

Candidates are rotated alphabetically. Answers may be lightly edited for formatting, spelling, and grammar. If you have questions for the candidates, please let us know at lydia.chavez@missionlocal.com.

151a2e2a-b307-4a85-a6b7-da0f4c6c3615,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,JOE ESKENAZI,"MARCH 25, 2024, 5:30 AM",‘Moderate-on-moderate violence:’ SF mayoral race’s next act,,"Do you know how many votes you get to cast for mayor in November? If so, you’re better informed than many of the folks working this year’s mayoral campaigns — or running in them — who tend to default to ‘a lot.’ 

They’re not wrong, but the Department of Elections informs us that the exact answer is 10. Ten! Can you imagine it? Can you envision the thought process behind parsing your sixth, seventh and eighth choices? It’d be like asking Elizabeth Taylor to rank her ex-husbands (and Liz would complicate her ballot by putting Richard Burton twice). 

Will most San Francisco voters dutifully fill out all 10 spots? Of course not; that’d be a lot to expect out of a voter, especially when, like the roster of a city Little League team, the talent level among the mayoral candidates really drops off after the top four or five. 

So, no, most San Francisco voters will not emulate David Letterman and craft their own Top-10 lists. But the vast majority will be voting for multiple candidates, as the system allows. The national ranked-choice voting advocacy group Fair Vote crunched 20 years of San Francisco data, and noted that the median number of city voters who’ve been opting for multiple candidates is 74 percent. 

That’s a lot of extra votes out there. Candidates neglecting, ignoring or disdaining the voting system we’ve had in place since 2004 are setting themselves up to be neglected, ignored or disdained. And yet, it happens more than you’d think. 

With the dust settling from the March 5 election, we’re entering into a period of what one pithy city player calls “moderate-on-moderate violence.” 

Up in the political heavens, our Masters of the Universe are turning on one another. Some of the billionaires will support the incumbent. But some won’t: Don’t look now, but Mark Farrell established a candidate-controlled committee last week to push the mayoral-strengthening ballot measures from Michael Moritz’s TogetherSF … which also enables Farrell to raise unlimited funds. 

On a more terrestrial plane, the competition for mayoral endorsements will be fierce. And multifaceted. This is a multi-front war. It will be fought over the now moderate-heavy Democratic County Central Committee, the big-money groups spending with sailor-on-liberty ferocity over the last several election cycles, neighborhood and ethnic Democratic clubs, and influential and quasi-influential individuals. When it comes to bending the ears of individual DCCC member-elects, we’re told, “the wooing season has already started.” 

Mayor London Breed’s team has, additionally, made it clear that it is not interested in any dual or ranked endorsements. This is a loaded decree coming from a sitting mayor who’ll be running this town for the next eight-odd months (and may yet win in November). It’d be nice if she picked up the phone for you, right? Political and governmental issues aren’t supposed to bleed into one another, but it often happens here on planet Earth.  

At this point, this is just a battle over endorsements. Breed’s demand that she and she alone be recognized makes political sense. It does not benefit her to have other people’s names and photos on the campaign brochures she’d rather have featuring her and her alone. That’s hardly unwise or crazy. 

But there’s a difference between consolidating endorsements for a campaign and actually running a campaign. And, at this point, everything seems to point toward the mayor having little interest in engaging with the ranked-choice strategy that has governed San Francisco elections for a generation and will decide this one, whether she likes it or not. 

Do you know what percentage of the time the candidate who wins the most first-place votes goes on to win in a ranked-choice election? According to the data sets over at Fair Vote, it’s around 94 percent. Didn’t Mayor Breed finish first in a 2018 election in which she put minimal effort into a ranked-choice strategy, and then hang on to beat Mark Leno and Jane Kim, who put a maximal effort into such a strategy? Yes, that happened. So what’s the big deal? 

Let’s address the higher-end issue first. Many elections, if not most, are not particularly competitive. If we had a ranked-choice contest on what to have for dinner and the choices were pizza, haggis or Scandinavian aspic, the permutations of RCV would not likely come into play. 

And that leads to the forthcoming San Francisco mayoral election — and how, in some ways, it’s 180 degrees different than the race Breed won in 2018. One thing it certainly isn’t is a pizza-haggis-aspic competition. It seems plain that this one is going to be competitive, and the notion of any of the declared candidates amassing a double-digit first-round lead, as Breed did in 2018, feels more than a bit fanciful. It certainly doesn’t feel like a solid assumption that our deeply unpopular incumbent mayor, who is running in the same ideological lane as two other well-financed competitors, is a lock to finish first at all. 

In that 2018 contest, Leno and Kim each garnered about 60,000 first-place votes. That was a good 30,000 behind Breed — but, combined, the two outpolled her handily. Over the course of eight rounds of ranked-choice tabulations, Leno gained on Breed, eventually losing by just 2,500-odd votes, a 50.55 to 49.45 tilt. 

In 2024, we won’t have two candidates neatly splitting the pie among voters less ideologically inclined to vote for Breed. Rather, now we’ll have multiple candidates on her side of the sandbox, splitting her voters. There is, clearly, a big center-left lane in which to run. Aaron Peskin is biding his time like Godot — And if he doesn’t come? We’ll come back tomorrow. And then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. But it figures he will eventually arrive. Perhaps as soon as April. 

Peskin is in no hurry. Why interrupt this moderate-on-moderate violence? But when he does finally enter, a ranked-choice strategy among his mayoral competitors would seem to be de rigueur. But it remains to be seen if these candidates can get over individual ambitions and personal animosity to agree on anything. Election professionals worry that these sorts of deals, at least early in the election cycle, project weakness. They also give your chosen voter base tacit permission to vote for another candidate. 

Election professionals, however, also know the value of (eventually) forming alliances. Candidates, though, often don’t; candidates can be the most inconvenient part of the electoral process for election professionals. So can voters, who are less ideological than political insiders and, messaging be damned, vote for candidate combinations that don’t make intuitive sense. One casualty of moderate-on-moderate violence may be punch-drunk voters. 

“There should be genuine concern about confusing voters,” a moderate operative tells me. 

Ranked-choice voting needn’t be confusing, but politics often is. In 2018, even up to the penultimate seventh round of ranked-choice tabulations, Kim and Leno held nearly 57 percent of the vote. The electorate, at that time, was clearly leaning progressive, so multiple progressives entered the fray, split the vote, diluted their collective leverage, and the mayoral contest was won by a moderate. It’s funny how that works. 

This year, the electorate would seem to be leaning moderate. And, lo, multiple moderates have entered the fray. Moderates have the clear advantage — and, as a result of that, every individual candidate is incentivized to stay in the race, work for his or her own benefit, and dilute their collective leverage. It has the potential to work out funny again.

Regardless, it will be fascinating to see what comes next — if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/moderate-on-moderate-violence-sf-mayoral-races-next-act/
d3a60606-0c41-46f0-adb3-f07119111d27,news,mission,PEOPLE WE MEET,NAOMI BETH MARCUS,"MARCH 24, 2024, 4:36 AM",Pulling his own tooth with a pair of pliers started Chester Moody’s career,,"Imagine having such a terrible toothache and no access to a dentist that you take a pair of pliers and pull your own tooth. Meet Chester Moody.

It’s 1958 in the Jim Crow South: Lorman, Mississippi, to be precise. He is 17 years old, attending Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college, and he is in excruciating pain. At the administration office, he is told it will be 21 days before a dentist visits the college, and Black students can’t leave campus.

So, young Chester Moody broke into the campus woodshop, borrowed a pair of pliers, and performed his own extraction.

“It took me a while to get the courage, but the moment I clamped the pliers around that molar, the pain went away,” recalls Moody, 84, from his dental lab on the 16th floor of the downtown Sutter Street Medical/Dental Building, where he fabricates dental prosthetics, including dentures, implants and more. “I now know that it was the gas escaping, but I couldn’t walk around with pliers coming out of my mouth. I was screwing up my courage to pull, and suddenly there was a snap and the top part of the tooth was gone! Oh, the smell was terrible, but the relief was instant.”

Born in 1939 in Coffeeville, Mississippi, Moody studied to be a teacher. “In those days in the South, there were two professions open to Black men: You could be a preacher or a teacher.”

He planned to teach industrial arts because, hey, he could sure wield those pliers. 

Dentistry had never entered his mind. 

Now, in life, there are all kinds of luck: Dumb luck and blind luck, bad luck and good luck and hard luck. In Chester Moody’s life, three lucky breaks changed his destiny. 

The first: After graduating from Alcorn College in 1960, he went to St. Paul, Minnesota, to visit family. “Now, my aunt was taking my cousins to get their teeth cleaned, and she said, “You come too, Chester,” and we got there, to the Mayo Clinic, and this dentist did the exam after my cleaning and said, ‘Whoever extracted that back molar did a terrible job, he left the root tips in.’ I laughed and told him that was me.” 

That dentist, Dr. Louie T. Austin, was the director of dental services at the Mayo Clinic, and “he fell in love with me for my story,” Moody recalls. “He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.”

Dr. Austin offered Moody a job in his lab, and taught him the trade. “This guy was the greatest teacher in the world. That’s where I got started, in the laboratory, and fell in love with it. “

Moody worked for Dr. Austin a few years, until he was drafted into the United States Army.

“I was going to defect to Canada, but my mom wept and wept, and so I said I wouldn’t go, and reluctantly stepped over the line.”

And here comes the second piece of luck. “I finished basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was scheduled to be sent to North Carolina to learn artillery. Three days before I was supposed to go, I get called into the orderly room where you get your orders.”

Even today, 60 years later, his face beams with delight as he quotes his commanding officer: “Private Moody, your orders have been changed. You are going to SAN FRANCISCO, to LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL. They need a dental technician.”  

He said he stopped listening after “San Francisco,” because he was so excited. He and a buddy had been planning a cross-country trip out here. “I called Jim immediately and I said, ‘Guess what? I am going to San Francisco, and my ticket is being paid by YOUR UNCLE!  Your UNCLE SAM!’”  

The staff dental technician at Letterman was being sent to Vietnam, and Moody was his replacement.

Moody arrived in San Francisco in February 1963. 

He lived in barracks at the Presidio. “Imagine waking up every morning and out your window, YOUR WINDOW, you are looking at the prettiest sight you ever saw, the Golden Gate Bridge.”

On weekends, he and his buddies explored California. “We went north, we went all along the south coast, we went east. Oh, I was in the service, yes, but I was enjoying EVERY MINUTE OF IT!“

Even today, after 60 years in San Francisco, Moody’s speech is molasses-thick with the cadences of Mississippi. His manner is courtly, and he is sturdily built, with powerful arms and hands. He looks much younger than his 84 years, and he often cracks up when he tells his story.

He had always intended to return to Minnesota after his service, but he met his wife, Georgette, in San Francisco.  “There were two ladies in the waiting room at the dental clinic at Letterman, and I overheard them discussing issues with their daughters. I went up and said, ‘Tell you what, you give me your daughters’ phone numbers and I’ll take them out and tell you what’s up with them!’ One lady sniffed, ‘NO WAY!’ but the other lady gave me Georgette’s number.”

They met in February 1965, and were married that May. Though they divorced in 1980, they remain good friends and have three children, now in their 50s, seven grandchildren and two great-grandkids. His second marriage, to Cora, born in Mississippi like himself, “and the world’s greatest cook,” lasted until her death in 2008.  

Coming out of the army, he recalls, “I rented a two-bedroom on Golden Gate and Steiner for $135 a month, and got a job right away” at $75 a week at Pacific West Lab, in the building where he works today. “I told the owner I would only work there till the snow melts in Minnesota.”

Moody smiles, “I tell people the snow never melted, so I stayed in San Francisco.” 

Pacific West Lab was busy. A hundred dental technicians worked there. Hawaii had no lab back then, so they also serviced all the dentists in Hawaii.

“Every Monday, three gigantic mailbags arrived from Hawaii, filled with dentures that needed fixing.”

Except for a few years at a lab in Oakland, Moody has worked at 450 Sutter his whole career. 

And now, the third great stroke of luck: A friendship that lasted 60 years and changed his life. Roman Braunfeld was a Polish Jew, a holocaust survivor. He weighed 60 pounds, had TB, and was almost dead when the U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald, where he was a prisoner. One of the American soldiers who rescued him was a Black sergeant, also named Chester. 

Braunfeld recovered in Switzerland, learned the dental technology trade, married, and emigrated to the United States in 1953.

Moody and Braunfeld had an instant rapport, a deep and abiding mutual respect. They worked together until their lab was bought out. Braunfeld left and started his own lab, Far West Dental, in 1970, on another floor; Moody followed shortly.

In addition to a thriving business, Braunfeld did pro bono work for those who couldn’t afford it, including recovering addicts at Delancey Street who had lost teeth to drugs.

They worked together until Braunfeld’s death in 2016. In 2006, Braunfeld sold the lab to Moody and his coworker, Lily Louie, age 65. Today, the pair work full time and employ four to five people, but it’s increasingly hard to find skilled craftspeople. The City College program from which Lily Louie graduated 40 years ago has closed. Much of the work is sent to China and other overseas labs, according to Moody.

Moody ‘s small studio is a throwback to an earlier time.

To get business, he goes around the building and visits patients in their dentists’ chairs. “I see 12 to 14 patients a day: I match tooth color, I design partials, and sometimes their dentures aren’t fitting right and the dentist will say, ‘Well, what can we do here, Chet?’“

Moody takes great pride and pleasure in his work. He sees it as a public service and an art. He tells the story of a 19-year-old patient, born with a terrible cleft palate. Moody manufactured an upper denture that was flexible enough to fold up to squeeze through the tight opening of his mouth. 

“I have incredible non-book knowledge that Dr. Austin taught me,” he says. “For instance, take your two front teeth. I was taught that from the top of your head to the bottom of your chin, the length of the front teeth should be one-sixteenth of that measurement. Back in the ’60s, you could get dentists to give you that measurement for a patient, but they don’t do that anymore.”

When asked about retirement, he gestures around the busy lab. The place hums and buzzes with the sounds of grinding and polishing. “I am having too much fun to quit.” 

On his break-room table are boxes of assorted chocolates and gourmet cookies, various sweets, all with thank you cards from grateful clients and dentists. “Help yourself,” he tells a visitor, “more work for me.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/pulling-his-own-tooth-with-a-pair-of-pliers-started-a-career-jim-crow-south-dental/

Answers are published each week, but we are also archiving each answer on this page for District 1, to make it easier for voters to browse.

Four candidates have filed to run against incumbent District 1 supervisor Connie Chan, who represents the Richmond, Lone Mountain, Golden Gate Park, Lincoln Park and the University of San Francisco.

Last Saturday, Chan also kicked off her re-election campaign. About 200 people attended the event at Argonne Playground, including labor leaders, several elected officials as well as a few dozen Asian elders who have lived in the district for decades. 

I’d love to meet district residents and on Tuesday, March 26, I will be in the Richmond at 10 a.m. at Lou’s Cafe, at 5017 Geary Blvd. Join me for coffee. Can’t make that meeting? I’ll be somewhere in the district every week. Check back here to find out where. 

The question for this week: How did you vote on the March 5 propositions and why?

All candidates, except the incumbent, Supervisor Chan, voted for Proposition E, which will limit police oversight, and authorize police officers to pursue vehicles and use drones and surveillance cameras. This aligns with District 1 voters: 53.68 percent voted for Proposition E. 

Only Chan and Jen Nossokoff, a physician assistant, voted against Proposition F, the measure that will mandate that those who receive benefits be screened for substance use disorder. District 1 voters backed Prop. F, voting 58 percent in favor — exactly in-line with the rest of the city.

Not surprisingly, Chan and her strongest opponent, Marjan Philhour, hold opposite views on Prop. B, C, E and F. Philhour’s votes are the exact match with how most District 1 voters cast their ballots. Note that more than $4 million was poured into pushing those campaigns. 

There’s one thing that all candidates can agree on, though: Bring algebra back to 8th grade.

95696828-872b-4412-b4cb-96d92201cb7b,news,mission,COMMUNITY,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 22, 2024, 7:00 AM",The 50-foot silk oak that towered over Valencia for at least 30 years is now a stump,,"A massive tree stump now sits at Valencia and 18th streets. Around it, a flow of pedestrians and bicycles stream through the intersection, hardly noticing the felled former silk oak.

But the stump is new; it’s the remnant of a silk oak — which, despite its name, is not an oak at all but part of a completely different family of trees — that city crews cut down on March 16. Its exact age and height were not recorded by the city, but it was at least 30 years old and 50 feet tall, according to an estimate by Allegra Mautner, a Public Works urban forestry inspector who has kept an eye on the tree. 

“It was kind of sad,” said Cassandra, who works at the nearby Fellow Barber. “It was just here one day, and then it was gone the next.”

The tree’s death sentence was issued only after multiple discussions, “because it’s such a high-profile tree, and it’s so important to a lot of members of the community,” said Mautner. Earlier, she discussed the issue with multiple supervisors at San Francisco Public Works before defining the tree a hazard that needed to be removed. 

“It’s a very respectful tree,” said Mautner, who’s now going through a process of coming to terms with the decision. “Every time I biked past that tree after I made that decision, I always felt like, ‘Am I making the right decision?’”

The coup de grâce for the silk oak came in February during a series of windstorms. It dropped several large limbs, and that was that. 

In addition, the tree’s excessive size had rendered its surrounding sidewalk a tripping hazard, impassable for people with disabilities. This constricted foot traffic and activities at a busy intersection, according to Mautner, one of San Francisco’s five urban forestry inspectors who collectively oversee the city’s roughly 125,000 street trees.

“This tree is very close to me,” she said. She has lived about a block from the silk oak since 2012, and she bikes past it every day on her commute. She took a longer look at the tree during the pandemic, when she did a lot of walking. She noticed the tree because it was a species she had never seen before. 

But that was also one of the factors necessitating its removal. “It had very poor structure, which is common for this species,” Mautner said. Plus, because of frequent failures of small limbs, the tree’s crown had grown much smaller over the past several years. Its roots also topped the sidewalk, and became more unstable after the recent storms washed out some of the soil underneath. 

“We really do try to maintain large trees in the urban environment, because they add so many benefits. but we also have to balance the risk that they pose to the public,” Mautner said. Throughout the years, the urban forestry team had added some asphalt patches to temporarily fix the area around the oak. These had degraded over time. City officials also considered a longer term-fix of doing more sidewalk work, but that was deemed infeasible because of the tree’s massive root structure.

Its size also prevented it from being transplanted. And even if moving the tree were an option, its deteriorating health made the odds of it surviving a transplant low.

Mautner conducted a final assessment in February, and deemed the silk oak a hazard. “I’m such a tree hugger. Then I have people who tell me that I’m such a tree hater, and I want to remove all the trees in San Francisco,” said the 34-year-old University of California, Berkeley, forestry major. 

Between Feb. 12 to 27, tree removal notifications were posted on its trunk, on the street light posts around it, and on the Public Works website. With an annual tree mortality rate of four percent in San Francisco, Mautner posts new removal notices almost every week to let the community know in advance that a tree is leaving. 

No one protested. 

Mautner took some selfies with the silk oak when she knew it would soon be gone. On March 15, an arborist removed the tree. Soon, the whole site will be paved over. 

A few days ago, Mautner passed an indigenous ceremony in front of City College’s Mission campus on her way home. She knew it wasn’t related. But it struck a chord with her. 

She took comfort in knowing that “the tree had seen so many activities like this, so many marches came by and it lived a good, long life. We were able to keep this tree for a long period of time.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/the-50-foot-oak-that-towered-over-valencia-and-18th-for-at-least-30-years-is-now-a-stump/
c396d7bc-e2dd-4d38-aaf0-f0e1d993999f,news,mission,COMMUNITY,BETH WINEGARNER,"MARCH 22, 2024, 6:00 AM",Mission Dolores curator aims to humanize site’s indigenous dead,,"For more than 30 years, Mission Dolores curator Andrew Galvan has been on a quest: To memorialize more than 5,000 indigenous people buried in the mission’s cemetery, some of whom are Galvan’s own ancestors. 

Galvan, a former archaeological consultant, remembers visiting Monsignor John O’Connor at Mission Dolores, the basilica’s pastor from 1983 to 1999, in the early 1990s, when the historic site was getting ready for a post-Loma Prieta seismic retrofit.

“We were having afternoon tea. He brought out the burial register and baptismal records, and we found my ancestors,” he said. 

Galvan’s ancestor, Liberato Culpecse, was baptized in 1801 at Mission Dolores, but later moved to Mission San Jose. Culpecse’s parents, Jobocme and Poylemja, are buried in the mission’s cemetery, along with 5,700 other indigenous people, in unmarked graves. After seeing their names in these 200-year-old books, Galvan started thinking about ways to make all those ancestors more visible. 

“I’ve collected the names of the Indians who were here during the Mission period,” Galvan said one afternoon in January, sitting in the pews of the old mission church. “Originally, I thought I could add an adobe wall and create plaques with all of the names. But even in 1992, it would have cost $1 million.”

Today, Galvan hopes to build a new, bigger museum on the Mission Dolores property that would include space for a plaque bearing the 5,700 names. The mission already has a small, one-room museum, but this one would extend into the adjacent playground for Mission Dolores Academy — which is part of the mission property, and was built over part of the mission’s cemetery. But the price tag has gone up: Galvan estimates the museum would cost $3 million to $4 million to build, and has only received donations covering a fraction of that amount. 

As he pursues his quest, Galvan said he’ll need to reach out to local tribal groups to get their input. 

“It would be a wonderful way for us to bring it into conversation, their actual names,” said Corinna Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in Oakland, the only local tribal group to respond to Mission Local’s requests for comment. “Giving them names helps to humanize them, which has been difficult for a long time in the Bay Area.”

Indigenous people have lived on the San Francisco peninsula for more than 13,000 years. In San Francisco, the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in several villages, including one near the present-day mission site, called Chutchui, on the banks of a waterway they named Ehwate. When Franciscan monks, under the guidance of Junipero Serra, arrived in 1776, they decided that Chutchui was the perfect site to build a mission. 

The Franciscans forced indigenous residents into labor. The mission church and other structures, including barns and barracks, were constructed by indigenous hands; not just Ohlone, but also Pomo, Miwok, Patwin and Wappo people from the wider Bay Area. 

Missionaries baptized the indigenous people who lived and worked at the mission, stripping them of their given names and rebranding them with Spanish ones. The hard work, near-starvation rations and waves of infectious illness killed thousands of indigenous people at the site. Galvan wants their names — their indigenous names — to be known again. 

Facing the steep cost of creating a memorial in the ‘90s, Mission leaders put Galvan’s memorial plaque idea on the back burner. O’Connor moved to another post in 1997, and it wasn’t until Galvan was hired as the mission’s curator in 2004 that he picked up the idea again. He wrote a number of proposals and grant requests, including one to the California Missions Foundation for what he called an “Indian memorial” at Mission Dolores. 

“The response I got from the committee was, “What about the names of the Spanish and Irish people buried there?’” Galvan recalled. “I said, ‘It says Indian memorial.’” The grant wasn’t approved. 

In 2009, the mission hired Galvan’s cousin, Vincent Medina (who’s now co-founder of Cafe Ohlone in Berkeley) as assistant curator, and the cousins took matters into their own hands. They bought a pair of redwood boards from Home Depot and carved the names of Jobocme and Poylemja — who are Medina’s ancestors, too — into the wood. They now stand in the mission cemetery. 

“The grave marker in the center of the cemetery is a tangible piece that visitors, community members, and family members can visit that gives proof to specific Native people buried at Mission Dolores. It gives recognition to two of the individuals that are interred there, and even without much label copy tells a story that is necessary to tell,” Galvan and Medina wrote in an academic article published in 2018. 

In that article, they proposed projecting the indigenous dead’s names onto a wall at Mission Dolores. That, too, proved difficult and expensive: None of the mission’s current spaces are quite dark enough, and the projector would burn through about $150 a month in lightbulbs. 

In any case, “I want something permanent, and having it adjacent to the graves makes the most sense,” Galvan said. In 2022, he assisted in creating a similar monument at the Franciscan mission in Sonoma, which reads, “In this sacred grounds lie buried men, women and children of the local Coast Miwok, Patwin, Wappo and Pomo tribes. They built, labored and died at Mission San Francisco Solano.” The site includes a stone etched with the names of 896 indigenous people buried there. 

Burying people in the ground and marking them with individual stones isn’t the traditional way local indigenous people honor their ancestors, though many do it that way today, said Gould, the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust co-founder. Historically, most buried their dead in large shellmounds that were built up with seashells, earth and other materials, and located them within their villages, so the living wouldn’t be separated from them, she said.

Sogorea Te’ works in the East Bay to reclaim local land and steward it in indigenous ways. Recently, the nonprofit opened ‘Ookwe Park through an adopt-a-park program in Richmond, where tribes will grow and harvest medicinal plants, including yerba buena, mugwort, wild strawberries and soaproot. The site once held a shellmound, which was destroyed in the construction of the Officer Bradley Moody Memorial Underpass, Gould said.

It also purchased the embattled West Berkeley Shellmound site in March, formerly the location of a village and massive shellmound that covered many city blocks, all the way to the waterfront. The group plans to unearth Strawberry Creek, currently streaming underground, and build a new, poppy-covered shellmound that visitors can climb. 

“We can show the magnitude of what a shellmound was. People can stand up high and see, similar to what my ancestors would have seen,” Gould said. The site will represent “not just the past and the horrific things that happened, but the resilience.” 

Although Gould thinks Galvan is on the right track, she called the Mission Dolores memorial “a first step.” The Catholic Church extensively harmed the indigenous people of California, and owes them “some kind of reciprocity,” or even giving Chutchui land back to the Ramaytush Ohlone, she said. 

Jonathan Cordero, founder and executive director of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, said the organization is working on some land-back initiatives in San Francisco, but none involving the Mission Dolores area. He declined to comment on the memorial plan.

For now, it’s unclear whether Mission Dolores will be able to raise enough money to bring its indigenous dead back into the light. Donations of any amount are welcome, Galvan said.

3c834636-4678-4365-9238-b01aa408f66e,news,mission,TROUBLE,JOE ESKENAZI,"MARCH 21, 2024, 12:30 PM",Former SF HR manager charged with looting $627K in workers’ comp,,"In January, San Francisco Human Resources manager Stanley John Ellicott was arrested and charged with a bevy of crimes, including purportedly selling electronics on the internet that had been bought with city money earmarked for earthquake supplies. 

This morning, he was arrested again and hit with more than five dozen charges — most notably, allegedly ripping off some $627,000 from the Workers’ Compensation bureau he oversaw. San Francisco jail records reveal that Ellicott, 38, was booked at 9:07 this morning and is being held on $50,000 bail for his 62 felony charges.

He is accused of establishing a bogus company and using it to loot the very branch of the HR department that he was charged with keeping both technically and monetarily sound. 

“The charges announced today reflect my office’s continuing commitment to uncover official misconduct in San Francisco’s City government,” District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement.  “My office would like to thank the Department of Human Resources for its swift and thorough cooperation in uncovering the depths of their trusted manager’s great betrayal.” 

The January and March cases against Ellicott are unrelated, but it was the investigation into the former that led to today’s arrest and charging. In addition to allegedly selling high-end consumer electronics bought with emergency supply money, Ellicott was charged in January with participating in a larger municipal theft and kickback scheme operated by former Community Challenge Grant director Lanita Henriquez and former Gavin Newsom mayoral staffer, businessman and city fixer Dwayne Jones. 

The District Attorney alleges that Jones’ company, RDJ Enterprises, paid Ellicott — a city employee at that time — nearly $270,000 over the course of four years. Ellicott then purportedly used Venmo and PayPal to funnel some $65,650 of Jones’ money to Henriquez. 

In an affidavit released today, DA investigator Mike Reilly reveals that scrutiny of Ellicott’s financial transactions regarding the earlier case unearthed a “long series of unusual deposits” into his personal bank account totaling more than $450,000. These payments emanated from a source the DA refers to only as “Witness 1,” a Chicagoan. 

Reilly reached “Witness 1,” who told him her old college pal Ellicott paid her $1,000 in 2019 to establish a company called IAG Services, and to set up a bank account for IAG services using her own name and information. She said Ellicott then took over the account. 

Department of Human Resources managers confirmed to Reilly that Ellicott himself added IAG Services as a vendor into the city system in May 2019. Starting that month and continuing until January 2024 — the month of his prior arrest — more than $627,000 in payments were made from the city to IAG. These “appeared to be fraudulent payments related to otherwise legitimate workers’ compensation benefits.”

While these payments were ostensibly for “auditing services,” human resources managers told Reilly that no paperwork exists to indicate that any auditing services were actually performed. Ellicott’s former colleagues were unable to locate invoices for most of the payments to IAG, and those they did locate were all approved by Ellicott himself. 

All told, the human resources department provided the DA with 643 workers’ comp claims billed to IAG. Most were billed just once, with a payment between $925 and $986. Between 2019 and January 2024, the total amount paid was $627,118.86. Email records indicate Ellicott either approved these payments himself, or asked colleagues to process them. 

The DA investigator traced more than $450,400 in payments from IAG to Ellicott’s personal bank account over the course of four years. These semi-monthly payments were denoted “Direct Deposit [Witness 1] D BILL PMT BILL PMT.” It was this series of regular payments that first caught investigator Reilly’s eye.

Following Henriquez’s arrest in August 2023, these payments were purportedly redirected to a different account tied to Ellicott. All told, the DA claims more than $488,000 was transferred between IAG and multiple Ellicott accounts. 

Ellicott began working for the city in 2012, with a brief hiatus between 2015 and 2016. He was a manager at the human resources department from 2017 until January 25 of this year, when he was placed on paid leave.

Transparent California lists Ellicott’s 2022 pay as $187,884, with benefits of $55,613, for a total compensation package of $243,496. His most recent position with the human resources department was “assistant director of finance and technology.” The human resources department describes his position as being “responsible for the financial integrity of the Workers’ Compensation Division” — the division he oversaw and allegedly looted.

The Department of Human Resources announced today that it has implemented new controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.

Ellicott’s 62 charges include grand theft, misappropriation of public money, insurance fraud and money laundering. He was arrested “without incident” this morning at his Oakland home, and will face arraignment tomorrow.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/stanley-ellicott-workers-comp/

For nearly 35 years, the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon newspapers have been solely supported by advertising revenue. When COVID-19 hit a few of years ago, we lost advertisers. After so many years of relying on ad revenue to create and distribute our community’s newspapers, the time has come to supplement the diminished ad revenue with donations from our readers. We could use our community’s help.

COVID not only caused many of our advertisers to stop their support, it also has made it difficult for small businesses to spend precious funds on advertising. We are hoping our loyal readers will be able to contribute a little to keep our neighborhood newspapers and website healthy. Plus, as small businesses continue to struggle, we are committed to not raising ad rates for our existing customers. 

A few notes:

• Our mission is to inform our community and to help small businesses. Your contribution will connect you to that mission – you can directly help your neighbors.

• California has lost a quarter of its newspapers and half its newsroom staff in the last 15 years. San Francisco has lost more than half of its neighborhood newspapers over the last decade or so. Your contribution will help the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon to publish for many years to come.

• Printing and delivery costs are going up. Equipment and supply costs are going up. Our writers, photographers and editors haven’t had a pay raise in years. Ad revenue is simply not enough to allow us to thrive. Your contribution will help ensure our continued service to our community.

• Our website, RichmondSunsetNews.com, averages more than 20,000 views each month. While we lose money on the site, we know that it is a valuable free resource for our community. It gives voice to our readers and shares information not published in our paper. Your contribution will keep the website free – no pay wall, no pop-up ads, no subscription fees.

• Longtime readers of the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon newspapers may have noticed that the papers have been 16 pages lately, versus the 12-page papers we have produced in the past. The extra pages allow us to tell more stories, publish bigger photos, add new features (cartoons, crossword puzzles, the Announcements section, using current photos alongside the historical photos – “Then and Now”) and more. Ad revenue alone can’t support 16-page papers. Your contribution will help us keep publishing the robust 16-page, and sometimes 20-page, papers.

We frequently receive compliments on our papers and are often told how much readers love reading the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon. We have even received unsolicited contributions; we haven’t forgotten your kindness and generosity Gale, Poonam, Maria Gloria, Beverly, et. al. Thank you! Also, thank you to Carmen Lee who has donated her time and talents to create the two “Best of the Richmond” surveys. We are very grateful for your community spirit!

SFPD Arrests Driver for Fatal Vehicle Collision

On March 16, at approximately 12:13 p.m., San Francisco Police officers responded to the area of Ulloa Street and Lenox Way on a report of a solo vehicle collision involving pedestrians.

Officers arrived on scene and located multiple victims suffering from injuries. SFPD officers and SFFD firefighters rendered aid to the victims. Despite life-saving efforts made by first responders, two victims were declared deceased at the scene. Three patients were transported to the hospital with injuries. 

Despite the lifesaving efforts of the hospital staff, the third victim, an adult female, succumbed to her injuries at the hospital and an infant is still suffering from life-threatening injuries.

Officers learned that the driver of the vehicle, identified as 78-year-old Mary Fong Lau, was traveling eastbound on Ulloa Street when she crashed into a bus stop at the intersection of Ulloa Street and Lenox Way. 

Through the course of the investigation, The SFPD Traffic Collision Investigations Unit developed probable cause to book the driver, Lau, for three counts of felony vehicular manslaughter, felony reckless driving causing bodily injury and additional traffic violations.

This is an open and active investigation. Anyone with information is asked to contact the SFPD at 415-575-4444 or text a tip to TIP411 and begin the message with SFPD.

This incident was a heartbreaking tragedy.  The San Francisco Police Department offers its deepest condolences to the victims, their families and loved ones, and everyone at the scene who witnessed and assisted first responders.

Demolitions, speculations, and displacement are in store if the city moves forward with Breed’s approach.

By Dennis Antenore

“There is no logic that can be superimposed on the city; people make it, and it is to them, not buildings, that we must fit our plans.” – Jane Jacobs

“Some who are fortunate to have communities still do fight to keep them, but they have seldom prevailed. While people possess a community, they usually understand that they can’t afford to lose it, but after it is lost, gradually even the memory of what was lost is lost.” – Jane Jacobs

 “If we wish to rebuild our cities, we must first rebuild our neighborhoods.” – Harvey Milk

The massive citywide rezoning proposed by the mayor and under consideration at the Planning Commission will have disastrous impacts on San Francisco and directly threatens our neighborhoods.

The state-mandated Housing Element of the General Plan calls for removing all density controls on lots in much of the western and central parts of the City, and dramatically increasing heights from between 65 feet to, in some cases, as high as 240 feet. These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.

The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. 

The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.

The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. 

The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.

There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.

This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.

What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. 

The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?

Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.

Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.

The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. 

The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. 

The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.

 The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.

San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community.

By Mark Dietrich

As an engaged member of our community over the past several years, I’m constantly approached by concerned, frustrated neighbors who ask, “Hey Mark, when are you going to run for D1 supervisor?” I tell them all the same thing: “I can do you one better – I’m supporting Marjan Philhour for supervisor, and so should you.” Here is why I say that with unwavering confidence and optimism for the future.

I met Marjan in 2019 and immediately saw my heart of service mirrored by her own. A belief that listening to neighbors matters more than talking, that results matter more than rhetoric and that leadership matters more than ego. If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.

Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   

… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   

Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. 

If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. 

Huh. Imagine that.

You can see it in the San Francisco Chronicle every Sunday: “Earthweek: Diary of a Changing World,” by Steve Newman

“A new study (by University of Rhode Island scientists) finds the microplastic pollution that now permeates the planet can travel to the brain and cause behavioral changes.” – Week ending Friday, Sept. 22, 2023.

“A new study by the Ocean Conservancy and the University of Toronto found microplastics now contaminate more than a dozen kinds of protein consumed by humans, including beef, breaded shrimp and even tofu.” – Week ending Friday, Feb. 2.

“Studies have found that microplastic pollution is accumulating not only in our arteries, but also in all 62 human placentas examined. … the particles have also recently been found in human blood and breast milk, which indicates we are being exposed to the pollution on a massive scale, as are other creatures. ‘If we’re seeing effects on placentas, then all mammalian life on this planet could be impacted,” said lead researcher Matthew Campen of the University of New Mexico.'” – Week ending Friday, March 1.

Artificial turf should never have been used in Golden Gate Park or San Francisco playing fields. It is toxic, pollutes the environment and poses a danger to all San Franciscans. The plastic grass is continually shedding micro-plastics and can’t be recycled or disposed of in a landfill. Phil Ginsburg, the General Manager of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, and Mark Buell, former President of the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Commission, are directly responsible for the presence of artificial turf in our parks. To this day, artificial turf and rubberized surfaces are being installed in playing fields and playgrounds. Micro-plastic pollution is a threat to all life on the planet. (see “Microplastics in Clouds Could Be ‘Contaminating Nearly Everything We Eat and Drink’: Study” By Brett Wilkins commondreams.org Sept 29. 2023)

To quote from the Petition (by the Sierra Club) requesting the City reject the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the renovation of the Beach Chalet Soccer Fields: 

“4. The artificial turf the City has elected to use consists of plastic blades of grass interspersed with infill material that cushions the turf. Unfortunately, the City has elected to use the most toxic type of artificial turf infill material – styrene butadiene crumb rubber (“SBR”), despite the fact that several non-toxic alternatives are available and are in use in places including Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Carlos, California; Piedmont, California; and dozens of other communities.”

“Scientists have shown that both the grass-like blades and the backing of artificial turf contain PFAS, highly toxic fluorinated chemicals. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” since they accumulate in the body and do not break down. They have been linked to endocrine disruption and cancer. Children are especially vulnerable to harm from PFAS because of their developing bodies and the chemicals’ persistence in the body.  Most people think manufacturers must prove that chemicals are safe before they put them on the market. They are wrong. Weak and outdated federal law presumes that most chemicals are safe until proven toxic.” – “Real Grass for Healthy Kids!”  greenwichfreepress.com  March 12, 2021.

By Shanta Nimbark Sacharoff

I love wild rice! When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  

Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. 

In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. 

Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. 

1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely 

2 cups of water

½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well 

1½ cups water 

½ teaspoon salt (optional)

2 teaspoons oil, any type

¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces

¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained

or 

¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained

First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.

In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. 

Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.

Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce.

Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund

On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. 

“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”

As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. 

Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. 

“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” 

After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. 

“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. 

Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. 

“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” 

“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” 

“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” 

“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” 

The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

Now that the latest round of elections is past us, and there is a bit of a break before November, I hope we’ll all refocus for the moment on taking our forever campaign of keeping SF clean to that next level. While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!

I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.

You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.

Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.

Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.

Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Another Milestone

The City and Alexandria Theater Developer Sign Initial Agreement

Today, Supervisor Connie Chan announced the initial agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was signed jointly by TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC and the Office of Workforce and Economic Development. Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  

“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”

Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. 

“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”

The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. 

The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. 

The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/

2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.

Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.

Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.

However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.

The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.

If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.

Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.

As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.

There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.

First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.

Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.

If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.

Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.

Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.

Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.

Public safety is the #1 concern for San Franciscans. That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.

Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.

Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.

Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.

She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.

Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.

Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.

Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.

Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.

“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”

Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval

I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.

The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.

Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.

The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.

That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.

It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.

We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.

Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.

The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.

Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.

If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.

Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.

We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.

Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.

This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.

Golden Boy Pizza, a popular North Beach neighborhood pizzeria known for its square slices of focaccia bread pizza, will be opening a new location at 1447 Taraval St. in the Sunset District.

The eatery will be coming to the Parkside neighborhood as early as mid-March, according to Julian Sodini, son of founder Peter Sodini.

The new location is in the former location of Marco Polo Italian Ice Cream, which will be relocating to 3886 Noriega St. in the spring.

“When my father (Peter) was head of the ship, when I was a kid, he expanded out to five or six locations, but we ended up returning back to the one (in North Beach),” Sodini said. “Now, we’re trying to expand again. Hopefully we can make this time stick.”

Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).

“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”

Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.

“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.

Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.

Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”

“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”

The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.

“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”

The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.

The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.

Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.

“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”

Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.

“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”

Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.

The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.

Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.

Patreon fundraising page for the Sunset Beacon:



For nearly 35 years, the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon newspapers have been solely supported by advertising revenue. When COVID-19 hit a few of years ago, we lost advertisers. After so many years of relying on ad revenue to create and distribute our community’s newspapers, the time has come to supplement the diminished ad revenue with donations from our readers. We could use our community’s help.

COVID not only caused many of our advertisers to stop their support, it also has made it difficult for small businesses to spend precious funds on advertising. We are hoping our loyal readers will be able to contribute a little to keep our neighborhood newspapers and website healthy. Plus, as small businesses continue to struggle, we are committed to not raising ad rates for our existing customers. 

A few notes:

• Our mission is to inform our community and to help small businesses. Your contribution will connect you to that mission – you can directly help your neighbors.

• California has lost a quarter of its newspapers and half its newsroom staff in the last 15 years. San Francisco has lost more than half of its neighborhood newspapers over the last decade or so. Your contribution will help the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon to publish for many years to come.

• Printing and delivery costs are going up. Equipment and supply costs are going up. Our writers, photographers and editors haven’t had a pay raise in years. Ad revenue is simply not enough to allow us to thrive. Your contribution will help ensure our continued service to our community.

• Our website, RichmondSunsetNews.com, averages more than 20,000 views each month. While we lose money on the site, we know that it is a valuable free resource for our community. It gives voice to our readers and shares information not published in our paper. Your contribution will keep the website free – no pay wall, no pop-up ads, no subscription fees.

• Longtime readers of the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon newspapers may have noticed that the papers have been 16 pages lately, versus the 12-page papers we have produced in the past. The extra pages allow us to tell more stories, publish bigger photos, add new features (cartoons, crossword puzzles, the Announcements section, using current photos alongside the historical photos – “Then and Now”) and more. Ad revenue alone can’t support 16-page papers. Your contribution will help us keep publishing the robust 16-page, and sometimes 20-page, papers.

We frequently receive compliments on our papers and are often told how much readers love reading the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon. We have even received unsolicited contributions; we haven’t forgotten your kindness and generosity Gale, Poonam, Maria Gloria, Beverly, et. al. Thank you! Also, thank you to Carmen Lee who has donated her time and talents to create the two “Best of the Richmond” surveys. We are very grateful for your community spirit!

We are hoping our community’s love for our papers and website will result in financial support during our Nourish Your Neighborhood Newspapers campaign.

SFPD Arrests Driver for Fatal Vehicle Collision

On March 16, at approximately 12:13 p.m., San Francisco Police officers responded to the area of Ulloa Street and Lenox Way on a report of a solo vehicle collision involving pedestrians.

Officers arrived on scene and located multiple victims suffering from injuries. SFPD officers and SFFD firefighters rendered aid to the victims. Despite life-saving efforts made by first responders, two victims were declared deceased at the scene. Three patients were transported to the hospital with injuries. 

Despite the lifesaving efforts of the hospital staff, the third victim, an adult female, succumbed to her injuries at the hospital and an infant is still suffering from life-threatening injuries.

Officers learned that the driver of the vehicle, identified as 78-year-old Mary Fong Lau, was traveling eastbound on Ulloa Street when she crashed into a bus stop at the intersection of Ulloa Street and Lenox Way. 

Through the course of the investigation, The SFPD Traffic Collision Investigations Unit developed probable cause to book the driver, Lau, for three counts of felony vehicular manslaughter, felony reckless driving causing bodily injury and additional traffic violations.

This is an open and active investigation. Anyone with information is asked to contact the SFPD at 415-575-4444 or text a tip to TIP411 and begin the message with SFPD.

This incident was a heartbreaking tragedy.  The San Francisco Police Department offers its deepest condolences to the victims, their families and loved ones, and everyone at the scene who witnessed and assisted first responders.  

Anyone with information is asked to contact the SFPD at 415-575-4444 or text a tip to TIP411 and begin the message with SFPD.

Demolitions, speculations, and displacement are in store if the city moves forward with Breed’s approach.

By Dennis Antenore

“There is no logic that can be superimposed on the city; people make it, and it is to them, not buildings, that we must fit our plans.” – Jane Jacobs

“Some who are fortunate to have communities still do fight to keep them, but they have seldom prevailed. While people possess a community, they usually understand that they can’t afford to lose it, but after it is lost, gradually even the memory of what was lost is lost.” – Jane Jacobs

 “If we wish to rebuild our cities, we must first rebuild our neighborhoods.” – Harvey Milk

The massive citywide rezoning proposed by the mayor and under consideration at the Planning Commission will have disastrous impacts on San Francisco and directly threatens our neighborhoods.

The state-mandated Housing Element of the General Plan calls for removing all density controls on lots in much of the western and central parts of the City, and dramatically increasing heights from between 65 feet to, in some cases, as high as 240 feet. These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.

The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. 

The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.

The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. 

The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.

There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.

This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.

What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. 

The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?

Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.

Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.

The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. 

The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. 

The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.

 The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.

San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community.

By Mark Dietrich

As an engaged member of our community over the past several years, I’m constantly approached by concerned, frustrated neighbors who ask, “Hey Mark, when are you going to run for D1 supervisor?” I tell them all the same thing: “I can do you one better – I’m supporting Marjan Philhour for supervisor, and so should you.” Here is why I say that with unwavering confidence and optimism for the future.

I met Marjan in 2019 and immediately saw my heart of service mirrored by her own. A belief that listening to neighbors matters more than talking, that results matter more than rhetoric and that leadership matters more than ego. If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.

Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   

… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   

Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. 

If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you.

You can see it in the San Francisco Chronicle every Sunday: “Earthweek: Diary of a Changing World,” by Steve Newman

“A new study (by University of Rhode Island scientists) finds the microplastic pollution that now permeates the planet can travel to the brain and cause behavioral changes.” – Week ending Friday, Sept. 22, 2023.

“A new study by the Ocean Conservancy and the University of Toronto found microplastics now contaminate more than a dozen kinds of protein consumed by humans, including beef, breaded shrimp and even tofu.” – Week ending Friday, Feb. 2.

“Studies have found that microplastic pollution is accumulating not only in our arteries, but also in all 62 human placentas examined. … the particles have also recently been found in human blood and breast milk, which indicates we are being exposed to the pollution on a massive scale, as are other creatures. ‘If we’re seeing effects on placentas, then all mammalian life on this planet could be impacted,” said lead researcher Matthew Campen of the University of New Mexico.'” – Week ending Friday, March 1.

Artificial turf should never have been used in Golden Gate Park or San Francisco playing fields. It is toxic, pollutes the environment and poses a danger to all San Franciscans. The plastic grass is continually shedding micro-plastics and can’t be recycled or disposed of in a landfill. Phil Ginsburg, the General Manager of the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, and Mark Buell, former President of the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Commission, are directly responsible for the presence of artificial turf in our parks. To this day, artificial turf and rubberized surfaces are being installed in playing fields and playgrounds. Micro-plastic pollution is a threat to all life on the planet. (see “Microplastics in Clouds Could Be ‘Contaminating Nearly Everything We Eat and Drink’: Study” By Brett Wilkins commondreams.org Sept 29. 2023)

To quote from the Petition (by the Sierra Club) requesting the City reject the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the renovation of the Beach Chalet Soccer Fields: 

“4. The artificial turf the City has elected to use consists of plastic blades of grass interspersed with infill material that cushions the turf. Unfortunately, the City has elected to use the most toxic type of artificial turf infill material – styrene butadiene crumb rubber (“SBR”), despite the fact that several non-toxic alternatives are available and are in use in places including Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Carlos, California; Piedmont, California; and dozens of other communities.”

“Scientists have shown that both the grass-like blades and the backing of artificial turf contain PFAS, highly toxic fluorinated chemicals. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” since they accumulate in the body and do not break down. They have been linked to endocrine disruption and cancer. Children are especially vulnerable to harm from PFAS because of their developing bodies and the chemicals’ persistence in the body.  Most people think manufacturers must prove that chemicals are safe before they put them on the market. They are wrong. Weak and outdated federal law presumes that most chemicals are safe until proven toxic.” – “Real Grass for Healthy Kids!”  greenwichfreepress.com  March 12, 2021.

By Shanta Nimbark Sacharoff

I love wild rice! When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  

Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. 

In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. 

Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. 

1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely 

2 cups of water

½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well 

1½ cups water 

½ teaspoon salt (optional)

2 teaspoons oil, any type

¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces

¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained

or 

¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained

First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.

In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. 

Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.

Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce.

3e194854-a8b5-4b30-99a3-ceef0729a288,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:

Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund

On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. 

“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”

As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. 

Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. 

“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” 

After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. 

“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. 

Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. 

“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” 

“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” 

“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” 

“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” 

The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

Now that the latest round of elections is past us, and there is a bit of a break before November, I hope we’ll all refocus for the moment on taking our forever campaign of keeping SF clean to that next level. While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!

I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.

You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.

Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.

Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.

Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Another Milestone

The City and Alexandria Theater Developer Sign Initial Agreement

Today, Supervisor Connie Chan announced the initial agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was signed jointly by TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC and the Office of Workforce and Economic Development. Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  

“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”

Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. 

“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”

The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. 

The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. 

The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
db6c5718-b461-4176-987d-05d6cabbf455,news,sunset,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us

2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.

Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.

Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.

However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.

The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.

If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.

Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.

As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.

There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.

First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.

Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.

If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.

Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.

Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.

Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.

Public safety is the #1 concern for San Franciscans. That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.

Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.

Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.

Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.

She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.

Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.

Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.

Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.

Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.

“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”

Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval

I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.

The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.

Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.

The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.

That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.

It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.

We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.

Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.

The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.

Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.

If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.

Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.

We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.

Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.

This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.

Golden Boy Pizza, a popular North Beach neighborhood pizzeria known for its square slices of focaccia bread pizza, will be opening a new location at 1447 Taraval St. in the Sunset District.

The eatery will be coming to the Parkside neighborhood as early as mid-March, according to Julian Sodini, son of founder Peter Sodini.

The new location is in the former location of Marco Polo Italian Ice Cream, which will be relocating to 3886 Noriega St. in the spring.

“When my father (Peter) was head of the ship, when I was a kid, he expanded out to five or six locations, but we ended up returning back to the one (in North Beach),” Sodini said. “Now, we’re trying to expand again. Hopefully we can make this time stick.”

Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).

“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”

Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.

“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.

Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.

Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”

“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”

The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.

“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”

The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.

The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.

Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.

“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”

Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.

SFMTA’s plan was released on March 14 as part of the five-year pilot program allowed by the passage of Assembly Bill 645. Six cities, including San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose, will use automated speed cameras to capture images of rear license plates of vehicles that go over the speed limit to penalize motorists in a bid to improve safety.<br><br>“We are anticipating that speed safety cameras are an important part of an overall what can be done on a street but not the only thing,” Hake said. “We believe that they're going to be most effective with engineering changes as well that change the roadway layout or change how fast you can drive on a street.”<br><br>San Francisco will be allotted 33 cameras to be placed around the city. The number is determined by the city’s population. The SFMTA plans to place the cameras in corridors on the high-injury networks, streets where collisions happen the most frequently.

Hake said it would be funded through the transportation agency’s operating budget to get a camera vendor and any revenue that is earned will initially go toward covering program costs with any additional income going towards traffic calming improvements.<br><br>Offenders would be charged a penalty at a cost of $50 to $500 depending on how many mph over the speed limit they drive. Violations would also be issued as civil penalties and treated more like tollbooth charges with the ticket going to the individual on the vehicle's registration.<br><br>Sam Thomas, who lives on San Jose Avenue, said a speed camera on Alemany Boulevard is “super important.”<br><br>“Alemany is super dangerous,” Thomas said. “We just had a neighbor who died on Cotter.

Dorsey was the main sponsor of the resolution.<br><br>“With the San Francisco Board of Supervisors’ passage of this resolution today, we’re expanding on our city’s commitment to its diverse communities by supporting the diverse community-based journalism that’s part of it,” Dorsey added.<br><br>The report titled “Local Voices on Local News: Community Perspectives and Policy Recommendations for Strengthening San Francisco’s Journalism Ecosystem” released in February looked at the community and ethnic journalism community landscape and held focus groups in different languages (English, Chinese Spanish and Tagalog) for several months with San Franciso residents to find what their needs are in reading local news.<br><br>“Local news is critical to our democracy, and we know that San Franciscans are hungry for more,” said Maya Chupkov, media and democracy program manager at California Common Cause in a news release.<br><br>One of the recommendations in the report was the idea of city departments shifting some of the advertising money they spend to independent media publishers that would help provide resources for community and ethnic media news outlets to stay afloat.<br><br>The report said community journalism news media outlets play a critical role in the media landscape as they report and cover news stories in the community and neighborhoods that are not necessarily the main focus of major news outlets in San Francisco.<br><br>“This investment in local media has proven successful in New York and Chicago, and will likewise ensure that our city government supports and communicates directly and effectively with readers of underserved ethnic and community media,” said Michael Yamashita in a news release, who is the publisher of the Bay Area Reporter newspaper.<br><br>At the request of Dorsey, the Budget and Legislative Analyst released a report last December to provide options for creating a program to direct more advertising spending to these types of outlets. The BLA report said 98 media outlets were operating in the city, but only seven publications were approved by the Board of Supervisors for an advertising contract to publish legally required notices for fiscal year 2023-24.<br><br>The BLA report looked at other cities that have programs where advertising and outreach expenditures go to community news outlets. Cities, namely New York, have codified into law that at least 50% of all print and digital advertising — excluding legally required notices — be spent in community and ethnic media outlets. A list of media outlets was compiled and an office within the mayor’s office was created to monitor the program.<br><br>The BLA gave city officials policy considerations if they were to pursue such a program like New York, including a vetted directory of community and ethnic news outlets and setting a mandated percentage of advertising that would go towards these news outlets. Additionally, the BLA stated the city would need to clearly define what is considered advertising, establish a system to track how spending will be tracked and reported and determine which community and ethnic media outlets can qualify as a city vendor.<br><br>San Francisco State University Journalism Department Chair Jesse Garnier said there should also be other criteria established to prevent political interference if community and ethnic journalism outlets were to receive money from the city government.

Days after advocates participated in their second school district meeting on March 13, the district let them know that both positions would come back, according to Maia Piccagli, president of the school’s Parent Action Council.<br><br>She wasn’t quite sure exactly why, but thought it had something to do with their advocacy. “I felt amazing, I felt really excited.

The school plans to hire a teacher to help with its fourth and fifth grades with the $157,000 saved, according to Delarios-Moran.<br><br>“I feel relieved, because it allows us to cut one less position,” said Delarios-Moran. “It gets us closer to where we were before in the first place.”<br><br>Twin Peaks’ Rooftop School TK-8 was not as fortunate.

Ferrall also determined that the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>Reyes, a worker with the nonprofit Mission Graduates’ after-school program, was arrested on March 5 at Everett Middle School following alleged improper contact with a student. He has been in custody since the arrest. <br><br>On March 11, Reyes pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment. His maximum time in prison would be 14 years for the charges, which include three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, unlawful sexual intercourse and contact with a minor for sexual offense, according to court documents. <br><br>A preliminary hearing was held today in Department 13 on the second floor of the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. Only Reyes’ mother and two other family members were in the courtroom’s audience. <br><br>Reyes showed up in an orange jumpsuit and smiled when saw his family members. Throughout the two-hour hearing, Reyes repeatedly looked back to exchange glances with his family, especially his mother. At one point, Reyes mouthed “Love you” to his mother, who nodded in response. <br><br>Deputy public defender Semuteh Freeman, who represents Reyes, said her client was comfortable participating in the hearing in English until a Spanish interpreter was available, saying that Reyes attended school and was educated in English from the age of 13.

He spoke with both Principal Alicia Blacknell and the alleged victim in the principal’s office at Everett Middle School. <br><br>Santana said the victim and Reyes had known each other for several months before the alleged rape. They had kissed several times prior to March 5, but had not had a prior sexual relationship. While Santana continued to describe details of the alleged rape, Reyes shook his head. <br><br>The purported victim took the bus to 16th and Mission streets, and then walked to meet Reyes at his nearby apartment, where the alleged rape took place, according to what Santana learned. The victim went to school after leaving Reyes’ apartment. Later, she felt physical pain and messaged Reyes. <br><br>While being interviewed by Officer Santana on March 5, Blacknell identified Reyes as the “boyfriend” the victim had mentioned to her. Santana also identified Reyes in the courtroom today.<br><br>On March 5, the alleged victim told Santana, a certified Spanish translator, that her communication with Reyes was in Spanish. Santana saw several screenshots of the victim’s text messages, in Spanish, with Reyes. He told the court that the principal showed him the screenshots, and he saw them again later after obtaining the alleged victim’s phone. <br><br>Both public defender Freeman and officer Santana agreed today that the resolution of the screenshots presented as exhibits in court today was so low that they were not legible. Still, Santana described what he could remember of the text messages.<br><br>He saw messages, including heart-shaped emojis, in Instagram DMs. He also recalled seeing the background photo of the alleged victim and Reyes’ WhatsApp exchange, which he said both sides could see: “The photo behind the entire series of texts that I was shown appeared to be the victim in a bra, wearing a small pair of jean shorts, looking away from the camera,” Santana said.<br><br>He also recalled the 12-year-old and Reyes calling each other pet names, saying “I love you,” and sending emojis of heart shapes and kisses. Once, Reyes even sent a Spanish sentence that could be roughly translated as “I wanna eat you up,” according to Santana.<br><br>But not every communique between the alleged victim and Reyes was so light. When the 12-year-old informed Reyes of being in pain after sexual intercourse, court documents list his responses as, “I’m sorry for being so hard” and “It only hurts the first time.” <br><br>Santana acknowledged that neither he nor his partner turned their body camera on when they interviewed the 12-year-old on March 5, because of the police department’s policy on such cameras.<br><br>The second witness, Sergeant Daniel Kelly, was assigned the case on March 5, and spoke to the alleged victim about Reyes that evening. According to Kelly, she first met Reyes in late 2023, months before Reyes started working in the after-school program at Everett. When the alleged rape occurred on March 5, the victim was aware that Reyes was working at Everett, and that day was her first visit to Reyes’ apartment.<br><br>Kelly said the 12-year-old named three platforms on which she and Reyes had been communicating: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The girl’s phone has been turned over to the Crime Scene Investigation’s multimedia evidence unit.<br><br>Kelly also interviewed Reyes at Mission Station on March 5 and described Reyes as “calm.” Reyes said he taught art and coached sixth, seventh and eighth grade soccer at Everett. Reyes, who has a young child of his own, said he believed the victim was approximately 16 years old. He also said they were in love with each other; “that nobody has ever made him feel the way Jane Doe has,” said Kelly.  <br><br>He said “other female students [at Everett] had been essentially throwing themselves at him in a romantic sense, trying to give him hugs, trying to locate him on social media, messaging him [so much] that he had to regularly rebuff them,” said Kelly, recounting a conversation with Reyes.<br><br>Reyes acknowledged that he knew the victim was too young to have a sexual relationship with him, Kelly testified.<br><br>Kelly has had difficulty locating the address of the apartment where the alleged rape took place. According to the sergeant, Reyes provided one address, while Kelly and his team found another. <br><br>The victim received medical care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. <br><br>Reyes has been held in jail without bail. “The Defendant is an employee at a middle school, and thus surrounded by potential future victims,” the District Attorney’s Office argued in court documents. <br><br>Attorneys of both parties and Judge Ferrall discussed whether Reyes should be moved to home detention, which Ferrall later dismissed, citing a public-safety risk.<br><br>Public defender Freeman said that, while Reyes did have a prior misdemeanor conviction in Richmond when he was 18, he has no other criminal record. Freeman said he has been shuttled in and out of foster care facilities since he was 13. Once Reyes was incarcerated, he lost the funds to pay rent for his apartment.<br><br>“I’m asking the court to consider the effect of prolonged incarceration on him. I do think that there are other non-carceral ways that the court can ensure public safety,” said Freeman. “I don’t think he’s a flight risk, both because we have a default here, but also because he has a child and mother, and he is co-parenting his child.”<br><br>Freeman also noted that the Central American Resource Center of Northern California has been working with Reyes and his mother on asylum claims.<br><br>“The people are concerned about public safety,” prosecutor Gooch argued. “He’s making comments that the young girls at this middle school who are in grades six through eight, are throwing themselves at him. He acknowledged during his interview that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that the victim was too young, but he did it anyway, because that’s how love works.”<br><br>“I agree he’s not a flight risk, but the risk to public safety, from the evidence I’ve heard, is severe,” said Ferrall, who said the material presented today in court was “extremely troubling.” <br><br>“I can’t say that I’m comfortable with a less restrictive alternative of home detention, given what’s happened, and none of which would have been prevented by him being on electronic monitoring in his apartment,” he added, adding that the fact that the alleged rape happened at Reyes’ home rendered home detention a risk.<br><br>The judge also mentioned that Reyes has inflicted a potentially lifetime impact on the alleged victim. He also found Reyes’ comments of other girls at Everett throwing themselves at him troubling.<br><br>Ferrall discharged the felony charge of sodomy of a person under 18 for lack of evidence. Five felony charges remain.<br><br>After the decisions were made, Reyes broke into tears, lowering his head while his shoulders shook uncontrollably. Reyes’ mother, whose eyes were red from a morning of crying, called out words of encouragement to Reyes in Spanish. <br><br>Ferrall also determined that he had seen enough evidence for Reyes to be held to answer, and the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>The court has prohibited Reyes from coming within 150 yards of the victim or having electronic, written or telephonic contact with the victim, or contacting the victim through a third party other than the attorney.  ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/everett-after-school-worker-accused-of-rape-remains-incarcerated-troubling-material-emerges-in-court/

26a37c73-cdd7-4c26-b199-abbc00f745e1,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,JOE ESKENAZI,"MARCH 25, 2024, 5:30 AM",‘Moderate-on-moderate violence:’ SF mayoral race’s next act,,"Do you know how many votes you get to cast for mayor in November? If so, you’re better informed than many of the folks working this year’s mayoral campaigns — or running in them — who tend to default to ‘a lot.’ <br><br>They’re not wrong, but the Department of Elections informs us that the exact answer is 10. Ten! Can you imagine it? Can you envision the thought process behind parsing your sixth, seventh and eighth choices? It’d be like asking Elizabeth Taylor to rank her ex-husbands (and Liz would complicate her ballot by putting Richard Burton twice). <br><br>Will most San Francisco voters dutifully fill out all 10 spots? Of course not; that’d be a lot to expect out of a voter, especially when, like the roster of a city Little League team, the talent level among the mayoral candidates really drops off after the top four or five. <br><br>So, no, most San Francisco voters will not emulate David Letterman and craft their own Top-10 lists. But the vast majority will be voting for multiple candidates, as the system allows. The national ranked-choice voting advocacy group Fair Vote crunched 20 years of San Francisco data, and noted that the median number of city voters who’ve been opting for multiple candidates is 74 percent. <br><br>That’s a lot of extra votes out there. Candidates neglecting, ignoring or disdaining the voting system we’ve had in place since 2004 are setting themselves up to be neglected, ignored or disdained. And yet, it happens more than you’d think. <br><br>With the dust settling from the March 5 election, we’re entering into a period of what one pithy city player calls “moderate-on-moderate violence.” <br><br>Up in the political heavens, our Masters of the Universe are turning on one another. Some of the billionaires will support the incumbent. But some won’t: Don’t look now, but Mark Farrell established a candidate-controlled committee last week to push the mayoral-strengthening ballot measures from Michael Moritz’s TogetherSF … which also enables Farrell to raise unlimited funds. <br><br>On a more terrestrial plane, the competition for mayoral endorsements will be fierce. And multifaceted. This is a multi-front war. It will be fought over the now moderate-heavy Democratic County Central Committee, the big-money groups spending with sailor-on-liberty ferocity over the last several election cycles, neighborhood and ethnic Democratic clubs, and influential and quasi-influential individuals. When it comes to bending the ears of individual DCCC member-elects, we’re told, “the wooing season has already started.” <br><br>Mayor London Breed’s team has, additionally, made it clear that it is not interested in any dual or ranked endorsements. This is a loaded decree coming from a sitting mayor who’ll be running this town for the next eight-odd months (and may yet win in November). It’d be nice if she picked up the phone for you, right? Political and governmental issues aren’t supposed to bleed into one another, but it often happens here on planet Earth.  <br><br>At this point, this is just a battle over endorsements. Breed’s demand that she and she alone be recognized makes political sense. It does not benefit her to have other people’s names and photos on the campaign brochures she’d rather have featuring her and her alone. That’s hardly unwise or crazy. <br><br>But there’s a difference between consolidating endorsements for a campaign and actually running a campaign. And, at this point, everything seems to point toward the mayor having little interest in engaging with the ranked-choice strategy that has governed San Francisco elections for a generation and will decide this one, whether she likes it or not. <br><br>Do you know what percentage of the time the candidate who wins the most first-place votes goes on to win in a ranked-choice election? According to the data sets over at Fair Vote, it’s around 94 percent. Didn’t Mayor Breed finish first in a 2018 election in which she put minimal effort into a ranked-choice strategy, and then hang on to beat Mark Leno and Jane Kim, who put a maximal effort into such a strategy? Yes, that happened. So what’s the big deal? <br><br>Let’s address the higher-end issue first. Many elections, if not most, are not particularly competitive. If we had a ranked-choice contest on what to have for dinner and the choices were pizza, haggis or Scandinavian aspic, the permutations of RCV would not likely come into play. <br><br>And that leads to the forthcoming San Francisco mayoral election — and how, in some ways, it’s 180 degrees different than the race Breed won in 2018. One thing it certainly isn’t is a pizza-haggis-aspic competition. It seems plain that this one is going to be competitive, and the notion of any of the declared candidates amassing a double-digit first-round lead, as Breed did in 2018, feels more than a bit fanciful. It certainly doesn’t feel like a solid assumption that our deeply unpopular incumbent mayor, who is running in the same ideological lane as two other well-financed competitors, is a lock to finish first at all. <br><br>In that 2018 contest, Leno and Kim each garnered about 60,000 first-place votes. That was a good 30,000 behind Breed — but, combined, the two outpolled her handily. Over the course of eight rounds of ranked-choice tabulations, Leno gained on Breed, eventually losing by just 2,500-odd votes, a 50.55 to 49.45 tilt. <br><br>In 2024, we won’t have two candidates neatly splitting the pie among voters less ideologically inclined to vote for Breed. Rather, now we’ll have multiple candidates on her side of the sandbox, splitting her voters. There is, clearly, a big center-left lane in which to run. Aaron Peskin is biding his time like Godot — And if he doesn’t come? We’ll come back tomorrow. And then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. But it figures he will eventually arrive. Perhaps as soon as April. <br><br>Peskin is in no hurry. Why interrupt this moderate-on-moderate violence? But when he does finally enter, a ranked-choice strategy among his mayoral competitors would seem to be de rigueur. But it remains to be seen if these candidates can get over individual ambitions and personal animosity to agree on anything. Election professionals worry that these sorts of deals, at least early in the election cycle, project weakness. They also give your chosen voter base tacit permission to vote for another candidate. <br><br>Election professionals, however, also know the value of (eventually) forming alliances. Candidates, though, often don’t; candidates can be the most inconvenient part of the electoral process for election professionals. So can voters, who are less ideological than political insiders and, messaging be damned, vote for candidate combinations that don’t make intuitive sense. One casualty of moderate-on-moderate violence may be punch-drunk voters. <br><br>“There should be genuine concern about confusing voters,” a moderate operative tells me. <br><br>Ranked-choice voting needn’t be confusing, but politics often is. In 2018, even up to the penultimate seventh round of ranked-choice tabulations, Kim and Leno held nearly 57 percent of the vote. The electorate, at that time, was clearly leaning progressive, so multiple progressives entered the fray, split the vote, diluted their collective leverage, and the mayoral contest was won by a moderate. It’s funny how that works. <br><br>This year, the electorate would seem to be leaning moderate. And, lo, multiple moderates have entered the fray. Moderates have the clear advantage — and, as a result of that, every individual candidate is incentivized to stay in the race, work for his or her own benefit, and dilute their collective leverage. It has the potential to work out funny again.<br><br>Regardless, it will be fascinating to see what comes next — if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/moderate-on-moderate-violence-sf-mayoral-races-next-act/
adcc2efc-23fb-4fac-b2fb-cda1cfeac7d0,news,mission,PEOPLE WE MEET,NAOMI BETH MARCUS,"MARCH 24, 2024, 4:36 AM",Pulling his own tooth with a pair of pliers started Chester Moody’s career,,"Imagine having such a terrible toothache and no access to a dentist that you take a pair of pliers and pull your own tooth. Meet Chester Moody.<br><br>It’s 1958 in the Jim Crow South: Lorman, Mississippi, to be precise. He is 17 years old, attending Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college, and he is in excruciating pain. At the administration office, he is told it will be 21 days before a dentist visits the college, and Black students can’t leave campus.<br><br>So, young Chester Moody broke into the campus woodshop, borrowed a pair of pliers, and performed his own extraction.<br><br>“It took me a while to get the courage, but the moment I clamped the pliers around that molar, the pain went away,” recalls Moody, 84, from his dental lab on the 16th floor of the downtown Sutter Street Medical/Dental Building, where he fabricates dental prosthetics, including dentures, implants and more. “I now know that it was the gas escaping, but I couldn’t walk around with pliers coming out of my mouth. I was screwing up my courage to pull, and suddenly there was a snap and the top part of the tooth was gone! Oh, the smell was terrible, but the relief was instant.”<br><br>Born in 1939 in Coffeeville, Mississippi, Moody studied to be a teacher. “In those days in the South, there were two professions open to Black men: You could be a preacher or a teacher.”<br><br>He planned to teach industrial arts because, hey, he could sure wield those pliers. <br><br>Dentistry had never entered his mind. <br><br>Now, in life, there are all kinds of luck: Dumb luck and blind luck, bad luck and good luck and hard luck. In Chester Moody’s life, three lucky breaks changed his destiny. <br><br>The first: After graduating from Alcorn College in 1960, he went to St. Paul, Minnesota, to visit family. “Now, my aunt was taking my cousins to get their teeth cleaned, and she said, “You come too, Chester,” and we got there, to the Mayo Clinic, and this dentist did the exam after my cleaning and said, ‘Whoever extracted that back molar did a terrible job, he left the root tips in.’ I laughed and told him that was me.” <br><br>That dentist, Dr. Louie T. Austin, was the director of dental services at the Mayo Clinic, and “he fell in love with me for my story,” Moody recalls. “He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.”<br><br>Dr. Austin offered Moody a job in his lab, and taught him the trade. “This guy was the greatest teacher in the world. That’s where I got started, in the laboratory, and fell in love with it. “<br><br>Moody worked for Dr. Austin a few years, until he was drafted into the United States Army.<br><br>“I was going to defect to Canada, but my mom wept and wept, and so I said I wouldn’t go, and reluctantly stepped over the line.”<br><br>And here comes the second piece of luck. “I finished basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was scheduled to be sent to North Carolina to learn artillery. Three days before I was supposed to go, I get called into the orderly room where you get your orders.”<br><br>Even today, 60 years later, his face beams with delight as he quotes his commanding officer: “Private Moody, your orders have been changed. You are going to SAN FRANCISCO, to LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL. They need a dental technician.”  <br><br>He said he stopped listening after “San Francisco,” because he was so excited. He and a buddy had been planning a cross-country trip out here. “I called Jim immediately and I said, ‘Guess what? I am going to San Francisco, and my ticket is being paid by YOUR UNCLE!  Your UNCLE SAM!’”  <br><br>The staff dental technician at Letterman was being sent to Vietnam, and Moody was his replacement.<br><br>Moody arrived in San Francisco in February 1963. <br><br>He lived in barracks at the Presidio. “Imagine waking up every morning and out your window, YOUR WINDOW, you are looking at the prettiest sight you ever saw, the Golden Gate Bridge.”<br><br>On weekends, he and his buddies explored California. “We went north, we went all along the south coast, we went east. Oh, I was in the service, yes, but I was enjoying EVERY MINUTE OF IT!“<br><br>Even today, after 60 years in San Francisco, Moody’s speech is molasses-thick with the cadences of Mississippi. His manner is courtly, and he is sturdily built, with powerful arms and hands. He looks much younger than his 84 years, and he often cracks up when he tells his story.<br><br>He had always intended to return to Minnesota after his service, but he met his wife, Georgette, in San Francisco.  “There were two ladies in the waiting room at the dental clinic at Letterman, and I overheard them discussing issues with their daughters. I went up and said, ‘Tell you what, you give me your daughters’ phone numbers and I’ll take them out and tell you what’s up with them!’ One lady sniffed, ‘NO WAY!’ but the other lady gave me Georgette’s number.”<br><br>They met in February 1965, and were married that May. Though they divorced in 1980, they remain good friends and have three children, now in their 50s, seven grandchildren and two great-grandkids. His second marriage, to Cora, born in Mississippi like himself, “and the world’s greatest cook,” lasted until her death in 2008.  <br><br>Coming out of the army, he recalls, “I rented a two-bedroom on Golden Gate and Steiner for $135 a month, and got a job right away” at $75 a week at Pacific West Lab, in the building where he works today. “I told the owner I would only work there till the snow melts in Minnesota.”<br><br>Moody smiles, “I tell people the snow never melted, so I stayed in San Francisco.” <br><br>Pacific West Lab was busy. A hundred dental technicians worked there. Hawaii had no lab back then, so they also serviced all the dentists in Hawaii.<br><br>“Every Monday, three gigantic mailbags arrived from Hawaii, filled with dentures that needed fixing.”<br><br>Except for a few years at a lab in Oakland, Moody has worked at 450 Sutter his whole career. <br><br>And now, the third great stroke of luck: A friendship that lasted 60 years and changed his life. Roman Braunfeld was a Polish Jew, a holocaust survivor. He weighed 60 pounds, had TB, and was almost dead when the U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald, where he was a prisoner. One of the American soldiers who rescued him was a Black sergeant, also named Chester. <br><br>Braunfeld recovered in Switzerland, learned the dental technology trade, married, and emigrated to the United States in 1953.<br><br>Moody and Braunfeld had an instant rapport, a deep and abiding mutual respect. They worked together until their lab was bought out. Braunfeld left and started his own lab, Far West Dental, in 1970, on another floor; Moody followed shortly.<br><br>In addition to a thriving business, Braunfeld did pro bono work for those who couldn’t afford it, including recovering addicts at Delancey Street who had lost teeth to drugs.<br><br>They worked together until Braunfeld’s death in 2016. In 2006, Braunfeld sold the lab to Moody and his coworker, Lily Louie, age 65. Today, the pair work full time and employ four to five people, but it’s increasingly hard to find skilled craftspeople. The City College program from which Lily Louie graduated 40 years ago has closed. Much of the work is sent to China and other overseas labs, according to Moody.<br><br>Moody ‘s small studio is a throwback to an earlier time.<br><br>To get business, he goes around the building and visits patients in their dentists’ chairs. “I see 12 to 14 patients a day: I match tooth color, I design partials, and sometimes their dentures aren’t fitting right and the dentist will say, ‘Well, what can we do here, Chet?’“<br><br>Moody takes great pride and pleasure in his work. He sees it as a public service and an art. He tells the story of a 19-year-old patient, born with a terrible cleft palate. Moody manufactured an upper denture that was flexible enough to fold up to squeeze through the tight opening of his mouth. <br><br>“I have incredible non-book knowledge that Dr. Austin taught me,” he says. “For instance, take your two front teeth. I was taught that from the top of your head to the bottom of your chin, the length of the front teeth should be one-sixteenth of that measurement. Back in the ’60s, you could get dentists to give you that measurement for a patient, but they don’t do that anymore.”<br><br>When asked about retirement, he gestures around the busy lab. The place hums and buzzes with the sounds of grinding and polishing. “I am having too much fun to quit.” <br><br>On his break-room table are boxes of assorted chocolates and gourmet cookies, various sweets, all with thank you cards from grateful clients and dentists. “Help yourself,” he tells a visitor, “more work for me.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/pulling-his-own-tooth-with-a-pair-of-pliers-started-a-career-jim-crow-south-dental/
fa5b1079-cae5-4e28-902e-64bc7464ba37,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 23, 2024, 3:01 PM",Mark Farrell’s pitch to voters? ‘Common sense.’,,"Three times within an hour, San Francisco mayoral hopeful Mark Farrell called on voters to use “common sense” to decide on their stance on city issues. <br><br>“San Francisco is moving away from just being ideological, this left and right, progressive and moderate,” Farrell said last night, to a sold-out crowd at Manny’s cafe in conversation with Mission Local’s managing editor, Joe Eskenazi. “Let’s just have common sense again.”<br><br>Farrell, like Daniel Lurie and Ahsha Safaí in earlier conversations, expressed his frustration with the city’s status quo, and strived to differentiate himself from the rest of the field, stacked with candidates who will be making their appeals to the same set of moderate voters. In particular, he proposed to remove all large homeless encampments in six months, wean downtown San Francisco off of its dependence on the tech industry, increase police staffing levels and open 24/7 clinics for drug users. <br><br>But, like others, he contrasted the San Francisco of today with earlier, better times. In the old days, if you told someone you were from San Francisco, said the 50-year-old San Francisco native, “It was met with a sense of awe, a sense of wonderment, even envy. And today you get, ‘Are you okay?’”<br><br>As he sees it, San Francisco’s public safety, street conditions and economy have never been worse. And that’s mostly due to a “plain and simply failed leadership,” said Farrell. San Francisco used to have more than 2,300 police officers when Ed Lee was the mayor and Farrell was a supervisor, he said. The same number now stands at 1,857, according to the police department. Farrell mentioned former District Attorney Chesa Boudin for demoralizing the police department. <br><br>“Since I left office, our population has declined,”  he said. “So inherently, crime should decline because of that on its face.”<br><br>The crime rate, however, did decline. San Francisco saw fewer cases of both property crimes and violent crimes in 2023 than 2018, the year Farrell left office. <br><br>“We need to have law enforcement in San Francisco, just on principle, to create a civil society, to make sure there is deterrent,” he said. “In San Francisco, at times in the past, that has been foreign. But I think it’s just common sense that needs to be brought back.”<br><br>Farrell argued that his 7.5 years at City Hall — seven years as District 2 supervisor and six months as mayor after Ed Lee died — had equipped him with “a consistent track record” that voters could predict his performance in office. <br><br>To him, Mayor London Breed’s track record has been inconsistent on a number of issues. Regarding the abandoned downtown, he said Breed’s ideas make the city look disorganized: “What we heard was week one, we’re going to build science labs. Week two, we’re going to build housing. Week three, it was a U.C. campus, and then it became a soccer stadium.” <br><br>Michael Petrelis, who is running for District 9 supervisor, disrupted the conversation early on from outside the cafe, holding a sign that read “Ban cars now!” and interjecting frequently. He blared criticisms of Farrell from a bullhorn, but the volume on the speakers’ microphones was turned up, and Petrelis left after some 20 minutes. (We reported earlier that Petrelis attempted to shut down the event and left because he was tired. Petrelis wrote in an email, “My goal was not to stop the conversation and my cameraman had to leave because he had a date. I didn’t leave because I was tired.”<br><br>Macy’s recent closure announcement “caught the mayor’s office off guard, and City Hall off guard,” said Farrell, who noted similar situations also happened with Nordstrom and the San Francisco Centre’s closure. <br><br>Farrell said Breed’s office does not have relationships with the city’s largest tenants, largest building owners and the equity and debt behind them. This situation wouldn’t have happened if he were mayor, he said. He wouldn’t have been blindsided, and would’ve brought everyone together and worked out a solution comprehensively, he said. <br><br>As for plans for a downtown recovery, Farrell said he would first focus on addressing public safety and street conditions, to create an environment where employers and employees would be willing to come back.<br><br>“Diversification” was his diagnosis for downtown in the long term. “You know, we were over-reliant on the tech industry,” said Farrell. <br><br>“To the point where everyone wore the same vest,” noted Eskenazi.<br><br>“I’m glad I didn’t wear mine tonight,” said Farrell, who sported a black suit and white button-down. He noted that the tech industry’s tendency to work from home has turned San Francisco’s downtown into a veritable ghost town. <br><br>How would the public sector fix things that it neither created nor broke? Eskenazi asked.<br><br>The power of tax incentives, Farrell answered. In 2011, Mayor Lee and the Board of Supervisors, including Farrell, managed to use tax breaks to attract Twitter to revitalize mid-Market. “But it didn’t work. We learned our lessons as well,” he said. <br><br>Twitter brought a Silicon Valley model campus to San Francisco, having an in-house gym, an in-house cafe and even in-house dry cleaning, which prevented the surrounding neighborhoods from benefiting much, he said. “If we do this again, we have to do it in a much different, much smarter way,” he said. <br><br>“I think unless we’re aggressive about [reviving downtown], we’re going to lose downtown forever in a potential way,” he said. <br><br>Farrell also wants cars back on Market Street. “Let’s just have common sense again,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to admit that taking cars off Market Street, it’s not a panacea.”<br><br>“Market Street hasn’t been safer, statistically, since we took cars off Market Street,” Farrell said. <br><br>Contrasting Farrell’s citation of statistics regarding street safety — but not crime, in which people “feel” less safe in spite of statistically lower levels, Eskenazi quipped “But I feel safer.” <br><br>As for this week’s tragic car collision at West Portal which killed a family of four, Farrell said the lesson he drew was that the city should be “very granular” about every single intersection. He said he learned from friends who live in West Portal that, prior to the accident, the local community had sent multiple emails to the city saying it was a dangerous intersection, emails that went unheeded.<br><br>When asked who he would fire as mayor, Farrell mentioned the head of SFMTA, Jeffrey Tumlin, to promote public transportation, bicycling and pedestrian safety. In particular, he mentioned SFMTA’s L Taraval Project. “You tore up the street. You took away every single parking spot in the name of increasing the time or decreasing the time it will take for a trolley to get down the road and down. But you know what you’re also doing? Killing. You’re killing a lot of small businesses,” he said. <br><br>And Police Chief Bill Scott, whom Farrell called “a very good man” who had simply been in the position too long. “At the end of the day, the average tenure of a police chief in the U.S. is three years, and he has been here for almost eight,” Farrell said. <br><br>Farrell also intends to back city charter reform on November’s ballot, to guarantee the mayor always has the power to fire or hire department heads in a “plain and simple” way. This week, Farrell created a political action committee to push two ballot measures that would do just that, while also allowing the mayoral candidate to seek unlimited campaign donations to ostensibly back those ballot measures.<br><br>Asked whether he would support Breed’s recent veto of Board President Aaron Peskin’s legislation limiting density in areas of his district, Farrell said he would.<br><br>“I need you to speak loudly so the people in District 2 can hear you,” Eskenazi said. Would they want 270-foot high-rises in their neighborhoods? <br><br>It’s not about housing, but about “sloppy legislation” inside City Hall, said Farrell. “We had last summer’s density increases that everyone agreed upon. We come a few months later and say, ‘Whoops, I didn’t mean that we’re going to density decrease.’”<br><br>Farrell sought to sidestep a pro-housing or anti-housing characterization, falling back on his “common sense” pitch.<br><br>“Where is this common sense, once again?” said Farrell. “This gets back to the YIMBY, NIMBY, different sides of the aisle, where it’s just a zero-sum game and somebody has to win. Unless you’re fully with us, you’re off the boat.”<br><br>“I do not believe that we need to upzone every single neighborhood in San Francisco,” he added, saying it is the wrong approach. “As is the approach to say that we’re not going to build anywhere in San Francisco. We can do it in a very smart manner.”<br><br>Farrell also promised to take out all the large homeless encampments in six months by offering residents shelter, which he did as mayor in 2018, he said. <br><br>He suggested having clinics for substance use care open 24/7. “We have to capture [drug users] when they’re willing to make a different decision. And to give them a chance for a better life,” he said.<br><br>And, on Day One, he would audit all of the San Francisco nonprofits working on homelessness, because the city is funding a large amount of overlapping services, he said. There could be as many as nine city departments that fund homeless spending, he said. “Many fund the same nonprofit, but don’t realize that they’re doing it, and have different metrics for how they’re measuring success.”<br><br>Asked which past mayor he would seek to emulate, Farrell pointed to traits of several different city leaders. Farrell appreciated former Mayor Willie Brown’s ability to simply get things done, he said, and Gavin Newsom’s bold approach to politics and policy. He aspired to Ed Lee’s patience and Dianne Feinstein’s genuine love of San Francisco. <br><br>He chose not to answer who his ranked-choice alliance would be, saying it was premature, but acknowledged that it would be a part of any mayoral candidate’s strategy. <br><br>If elected, Farrell, who was the longest-serving Board of Supervisors budget chair in San Francisco’s history, will also be one of the first — if not the first — mayors of a major American city who is a venture capitalist. His finance background, he said, would be “super relevant” to the fate of San Francisco, a city that has a projected budget deficit of $728 million in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, and a 36 percent office-vacancy rate. <br><br>“It is amazing to me that what City Hall is turning to is just a blame game … No one’s willing to take leadership and accountability,” he said. “We need that back in San Francisco if we’re going to bring our city back.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mark-farrells-common-sense/

ASCARRUNZ,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:40 AM","Review: Foliage, Precita Park spot offering prix fixe menu, can do better",,"Foliage opened in October 2023 in the space vacated by Michelin-starred Marlena, which has since moved to Japantown as the already acclaimed Adams 7 — Japantown’s gain, our loss. <br><br>Foliage owners Stephane Roulland and Julia Indovina brought in Chef Mo Béjar to the beautiful corner space by Precita Park. When my editor asked me to review the new restaurant at their publicist’s request, I was salivating at the prospect of trying another somewhat affordable ($75) prix-fixe menu in the area. Béjar hails from the Central Valley, and his dishes have the requisite farm-to-table, sustainable and beautiful aesthetic, and they sounded interesting and fresh, with a few culinary twists and turns. <br><br>We started out with the house-made milk bread with cultured butter. The other option was the bread with a spiced salt and Spanish jamón, but we went for the basic. <br><br>This gorgeous golden orb came to the table, warm and inviting, with a very generous slab of butter, gleaming with crystals of crunchy salt. Plenty for us to have two wedges apiece, the interior was fluffy and yeasty, and gave us high hopes for the rest of the meal. Besides, who ever gives you enough butter with your bread? <br><br>The prix-fixe menu at Foliage offers two options per course, plus some optional add-ons. We decided to get each of the options, so that we would get to taste everything.<br><br>First course: Amberjack crudo with lacto-fermented pineapple, banana, macadamia nuts, and thinly sliced kohlrabi. <br><br>The vegetarian option: Avocado with essentially the same ingredients.<br><br>Both had a little funk, with an inexplicable paprika oil at the bottom of the bowls. The amberjack was lovely, but it was an odd combination of flavors; banana and fish connote a somewhat Caribbean vibe, but it didn’t really work for us. We were also a bit puzzled about the choice to take the same ingredients and simply substitute avocado for the protein. It seemed to me that here was a perfect, missed opportunity to make a wholly different, inventive vegetarian option. While we weren’t thrilled with the amberjack dish, the vegetarian option was lackluster. <br><br>Second course: Shrimp toast and ricotta gnocchi.<br><br>Beautiful dishes, both. The Foliage shrimp toast was wonderful; super crispy, light, highly spiced, with a Sichuan peppercorn aioli, and perfectly cooked shrimp. I’d get it again (and, in fact, I did). Our only quibble was the Osetra caviar was wasted on this. You literally could not taste it with everything else going on.<br><br>The gnocchi dish came with a lovely gorgonzola sauce, pooled under beautifully wilted and browned sweet cabbage, topped with fried sage and toasted nuts. Unfortunately, the cabbage was the best thing on the plate; the ricotta gnocchi themselves were severely tough and dense. We found them inedible, and when the runner eventually came around to ask if he could take the plate (without asking why the dish was untouched), I told him that the gnocchi were very hard. He apologized profusely and said he would tell the chef. When he returned, he informed us the chef admitted that they were usually softer, and asked if we wanted him to try making them again, or did we want another shrimp toast? Perhaps we should have taken him up on the offer for a re-do, but we took the safe-bet toast. My question is: How does that go out to a table? And were others eating those heavy gnocchi without complaint?<br><br>At that point, the courses seemed to have slowed down. I’d finished a glass of Cremant bubbly, and asked the runner for the list so I could order a glass of wine. He misheard me, and brought another glass of the same sparkling wine. He apologized, and began to take it back, but my sister said she would just take it so it wouldn’t go to waste. She hadn’t planned on having alcohol with dinner. I ordered a very good cabernet.<br><br>Next came our entrée courses. The options were local cod over sweet potato puree with fava greens and charred leeks, or roasted cauliflower with a vadouvan crema for the vegetarian dish. Or, for an additional $15, a coulotte steak (described by our server as “the best cut, the top of the sirloin.”) with mole, chayote, citrus, and chocolate jus. Sold! We ordered the fish and the steak.<br><br>The cod was a bit on the small side, slightly overdone, the skin could have been a little crisper for my taste, but overall had good flavor. The underlying sweet potato puree and leeks were good, the garum (an ancient Roman fish sauce) very subtle. I was busy eating my portion of the fish before switching off with my sister, so I didn’t notice she was having trouble with the steak.<br><br>When they first put the dish on the table, I asked if the thin brown sauce underneath the steak was the mole, and our runner said no, that’s the chocolate jus. A minute later, the chef himself came by with an extra little ramekin of the orange mole, which had been hiding under the chayote. A nice gesture, though I hadn’t asked for more; I just hadn’t seen it on the plate. We chatted with Chef Béjar a few minutes, asked where he’d cooked before, wished him well. <br><br>The steak was rare (which we both like), and I finally noticed my sister sawing away at the meat for an interminable amount of time. She looked at me in disbelief. “You need to cut this into really small pieces, or you won’t be able to chew it.” I tried my hand at it and, sure enough, it took at least 10 seconds to hack free a tiny piece, and then another 10 to chew it until it was soft enough to swallow. Again, we just could not eat it. The Foliage mole itself was — sorry, the only word I can think of is strange — citrusy, and unlike any other mole I’d ever had. The chayote was hard and flavorless. Our server finally came by and asked us how we were enjoying the course as she stared at the full plate. I demonstrated how hard it was to cut through the meat. She replied, “Yes, because it’s a very chewy cut.” Before I could show my amazement at this explanation, she quickly asked if she should take it away and I said “yes, please.”<br><br>In all the time I’ve been reviewing for Mission Local, I really can’t remember sending a dish back, much less two in one meal. By this point, we were looking around at the quite full restaurant and wondering if it was just us? We’re normally not that picky (in fact, I often get accused of liking everything indiscriminately), and we don’t relish making a scene. It was baffling, as no one else seemed to be having an issue, but seemed to be enjoying their meals thoroughly. <br><br>Dessert course: One was a mango semifreddo with tuile crumbles, a little mango jelly, and mint. <br><br>“Semifreddo” means “partially frozen.” The ice cream here, unfortunately, was a solid disk, and we had to wait a bit for it to soften. It tasted fine, however; very subtly mango flavored. <br><br>The other dessert was a white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries. The panna cotta was nicely creamy and, thankfully, not too sweet. All in all, there was nothing wrong with the desserts; they were simply unremarkable.<br><br>And the perfect ending to our meal? As I reached for the bill, my hand hit my glass which still had some wine in it — only my second glass of the evening, mind you — and in dramatic fashion knocked it onto the table, smashing it loudly, flinging wine and bits of glass everywhere. A shard actually drew blood from my sister’s hand. Mortified, I now saw myself through the eyes of our servers and chef: “Oh, was that the drunk woman who complained about everything?” I apologized over and over, all were gracious, mopping up the mess and making light of the incident. The Foliage staff handled it with class and kindness.<br><br>They also graciously took the $15 steak off our bill without my asking, charged us for the wine that was a mistake (which, yes, we’d drank), and handed us a bill for close to $250. <br><br>It truly pains me to write a review like this. Anyone can make a mistake; a bad dish can happen to any kitchen, but don’t send it out. If a cut of beef is so chewy, cook it some other way. The deficiencies in the dishes we disliked were basic errors in execution. I know it is an excruciatingly difficult thing to open, run, and maintain a restaurant for any length of time, in this city, or anywhere. What a feather in Chef Béjar’s cap to have opened in this lovely space, with a ready-made clientele mourning the loss of their beloved Marlena. (NB: I never told anyone at the restaurant that I was reviewing that night, even though we’d been asked to do so.)<br><br>I’m hoping this was simply an anomaly, as I’m rooting for Chef Béjar to achieve success in that space, and for Foliage to become a neighborhood mainstay, as I’m sure the Precita Park community is hoping as well. <br><br>Foliage SF (website)

It was the day of their wedding anniversary, and they were waiting for the bus to go to the zoo. <br><br>The driver, Mary Fong Lau, 78, was driving the wrong way down Ulloa Street. She was arrested the following day, and police are still investigating the incident.

He promised that, as supervisor, he would work with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to identify all danger zones in District 7 and “take precautions to make sure we avoid tragedies like this,” though, in 100 words, he did not specify exactly how. <br><br>The city has failed in its Vision Zero goal: Fatal collisions have increased since 2014, and 2022 saw the most traffic deaths in San Francisco since 2007.<br><br>For Martin-Pinto, it is “important to let the facts come out in this case” before proposing solutions, though he did suggest changing the configuration of bus stops and enforcing traffic regulations. Likewise, the two other candidates noted that lack of traffic enforcement is an issue. <br><br>Traffic enforcement has collapsed across San Francisco since 2014, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Police officers are issuing a small fraction of the citations they did 10 years ago, leading supervisors to hold pointed inquiries into the problem last year. <br><br>Melgar, for her part, pointed to both enforcement and slowing down cars, alongside physical protective infrastructure like bollards. She also went further by suggesting that certain areas around public transportation hubs should be fully pedestrianized and closed to cars altogether. <br><br>Their answers are below, but I also wanted to let you know that I will be in your district on Monday, March 25 at 1 p.m. at Ballast Coffee (329 West Portal Ave.).

Around it, a flow of pedestrians and bicycles stream through the intersection, hardly noticing the felled former silk oak.<br><br>But the stump is new; it’s the remnant of a silk oak — which, despite its name, is not an oak at all but part of a completely different family of trees — that city crews cut down on March 16. Its exact age and height were not recorded by the city, but it was at least 30 years old and 50 feet tall, according to an estimate by Allegra Mautner, a Public Works urban forestry inspector who has kept an eye on the tree. <br><br>“It was kind of sad,” said Cassandra, who works at the nearby Fellow Barber. “It was just here one day, and then it was gone the next.”<br><br>The tree’s death sentence was issued only after multiple discussions, “because it’s such a high-profile tree, and it’s so important to a lot of members of the community,” said Mautner. Earlier, she discussed the issue with multiple supervisors at San Francisco Public Works before defining the tree a hazard that needed to be removed. <br><br>“It’s a very respectful tree,” said Mautner, who’s now going through a process of coming to terms with the decision. “Every time I biked past that tree after I made that decision, I always felt like, ‘Am I making the right decision?’”<br><br>The coup de grâce for the silk oak came in February during a series of windstorms. It dropped several large limbs, and that was that. <br><br>In addition, the tree’s excessive size had rendered its surrounding sidewalk a tripping hazard, impassable for people with disabilities. This constricted foot traffic and activities at a busy intersection, according to Mautner, one of San Francisco’s five urban forestry inspectors who collectively oversee the city’s roughly 125,000 street trees.<br><br>“This tree is very close to me,” she said. She has lived about a block from the silk oak since 2012, and she bikes past it every day on her commute. She took a longer look at the tree during the pandemic, when she did a lot of walking. She noticed the tree because it was a species she had never seen before. <br><br>But that was also one of the factors necessitating its removal. “It had very poor structure, which is common for this species,” Mautner said. Plus, because of frequent failures of small limbs, the tree’s crown had grown much smaller over the past several years. Its roots also topped the sidewalk, and became more unstable after the recent storms washed out some of the soil underneath. <br><br>“We really do try to maintain large trees in the urban environment, because they add so many benefits. but we also have to balance the risk that they pose to the public,” Mautner said. Throughout the years, the urban forestry team had added some asphalt patches to temporarily fix the area around the oak. These had degraded over time. City officials also considered a longer term-fix of doing more sidewalk work, but that was deemed infeasible because of the tree’s massive root structure.<br><br>Its size also prevented it from being transplanted. And even if moving the tree were an option, its deteriorating health made the odds of it surviving a transplant low.<br><br>Mautner conducted a final assessment in February, and deemed the silk oak a hazard. “I’m such a tree hugger. Then I have people who tell me that I’m such a tree hater, and I want to remove all the trees in San Francisco,” said the 34-year-old University of California, Berkeley, forestry major. <br><br>Between Feb. 12 to 27, tree removal notifications were posted on its trunk, on the street light posts around it, and on the Public Works website. With an annual tree mortality rate of four percent in San Francisco, Mautner posts new removal notices almost every week to let the community know in advance that a tree is leaving. <br><br>No one protested. <br><br>Mautner took some selfies with the silk oak when she knew it would soon be gone. On March 15, an arborist removed the tree. Soon, the whole site will be paved over. <br><br>A few days ago, Mautner passed an indigenous ceremony in front of City College’s Mission campus on her way home. She knew it wasn’t related. But it struck a chord with her. <br><br>She took comfort in knowing that “the tree had seen so many activities like this, so many marches came by and it lived a good, long life. We were able to keep this tree for a long period of time.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/the-50-foot-oak-that-towered-over-valencia-and-18th-for-at-least-30-years-is-now-a-stump/

Culpecse’s parents, Jobocme and Poylemja, are buried in the mission’s cemetery, along with 5,700 other indigenous people, in unmarked graves. After seeing their names in these 200-year-old books, Galvan started thinking about ways to make all those ancestors more visible. <br><br>“I’ve collected the names of the Indians who were here during the Mission period,” Galvan said one afternoon in January, sitting in the pews of the old mission church. “Originally, I thought I could add an adobe wall and create plaques with all of the names. But even in 1992, it would have cost $1 million.”<br><br>Today, Galvan hopes to build a new, bigger museum on the Mission Dolores property that would include space for a plaque bearing the 5,700 names. The mission already has a small, one-room museum, but this one would extend into the adjacent playground for Mission Dolores Academy — which is part of the mission property, and was built over part of the mission’s cemetery. But the price tag has gone up: Galvan estimates the museum would cost $3 million to $4 million to build, and has only received donations covering a fraction of that amount. <br><br>As he pursues his quest, Galvan said he’ll need to reach out to local tribal groups to get their input. <br><br>“It would be a wonderful way for us to bring it into conversation, their actual names,” said Corinna Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in Oakland, the only local tribal group to respond to Mission Local’s requests for comment. “Giving them names helps to humanize them, which has been difficult for a long time in the Bay Area.”<br><br>Indigenous people have lived on the San Francisco peninsula for more than 13,000 years. In San Francisco, the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in several villages, including one near the present-day mission site, called Chutchui, on the banks of a waterway they named Ehwate. When Franciscan monks, under the guidance of Junipero Serra, arrived in 1776, they decided that Chutchui was the perfect site to build a mission. <br><br>The Franciscans forced indigenous residents into labor. The mission church and other structures, including barns and barracks, were constructed by indigenous hands; not just Ohlone, but also Pomo, Miwok, Patwin and Wappo people from the wider Bay Area. <br><br>Missionaries baptized the indigenous people who lived and worked at the mission, stripping them of their given names and rebranding them with Spanish ones. The hard work, near-starvation rations and waves of infectious illness killed thousands of indigenous people at the site. Galvan wants their names — their indigenous names — to be known again. <br><br>Facing the steep cost of creating a memorial in the ‘90s, Mission leaders put Galvan’s memorial plaque idea on the back burner. O’Connor moved to another post in 1997, and it wasn’t until Galvan was hired as the mission’s curator in 2004 that he picked up the idea again. He wrote a number of proposals and grant requests, including one to the California Missions Foundation for what he called an “Indian memorial” at Mission Dolores. <br><br>“The response I got from the committee was, “What about the names of the Spanish and Irish people buried there?’” Galvan recalled. “I said, ‘It says Indian memorial.’” The grant wasn’t approved. <br><br>In 2009, the mission hired Galvan’s cousin, Vincent Medina (who’s now co-founder of Cafe Ohlone in Berkeley) as assistant curator, and the cousins took matters into their own hands. They bought a pair of redwood boards from Home Depot and carved the names of Jobocme and Poylemja — who are Medina’s ancestors, too — into the wood. They now stand in the mission cemetery. <br><br>“The grave marker in the center of the cemetery is a tangible piece that visitors, community members, and family members can visit that gives proof to specific Native people buried at Mission Dolores. It gives recognition to two of the individuals that are interred there, and even without much label copy tells a story that is necessary to tell,” Galvan and Medina wrote in an academic article published in 2018. <br><br>In that article, they proposed projecting the indigenous dead’s names onto a wall at Mission Dolores. That, too, proved difficult and expensive: None of the mission’s current spaces are quite dark enough, and the projector would burn through about $150 a month in lightbulbs. <br><br>In any case, “I want something permanent, and having it adjacent to the graves makes the most sense,” Galvan said. In 2022, he assisted in creating a similar monument at the Franciscan mission in Sonoma, which reads, “In this sacred grounds lie buried men, women and children of the local Coast Miwok, Patwin, Wappo and Pomo tribes. They built, labored and died at Mission San Francisco Solano.” The site includes a stone etched with the names of 896 indigenous people buried there. <br><br>Burying people in the ground and marking them with individual stones isn’t the traditional way local indigenous people honor their ancestors, though many do it that way today, said Gould, the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust co-founder. Historically, most buried their dead in large shellmounds that were built up with seashells, earth and other materials, and located them within their villages, so the living wouldn’t be separated from them, she said.<br><br>Sogorea Te’ works in the East Bay to reclaim local land and steward it in indigenous ways. Recently, the nonprofit opened ‘Ookwe Park through an adopt-a-park program in Richmond, where tribes will grow and harvest medicinal plants, including yerba buena, mugwort, wild strawberries and soaproot. The site once held a shellmound, which was destroyed in the construction of the Officer Bradley Moody Memorial Underpass, Gould said.<br><br>It also purchased the embattled West Berkeley Shellmound site in March, formerly the location of a village and massive shellmound that covered many city blocks, all the way to the waterfront. The group plans to unearth Strawberry Creek, currently streaming underground, and build a new, poppy-covered shellmound that visitors can climb. <br><br>“We can show the magnitude of what a shellmound was. People can stand up high and see, similar to what my ancestors would have seen,” Gould said. The site will represent “not just the past and the horrific things that happened, but the resilience.” <br><br>Although Gould thinks Galvan is on the right track, she called the Mission Dolores memorial “a first step.” The Catholic Church extensively harmed the indigenous people of California, and owes them “some kind of reciprocity,” or even giving Chutchui land back to the Ramaytush Ohlone, she said. <br><br>Jonathan Cordero, founder and executive director of the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone, said the organization is working on some land-back initiatives in San Francisco, but none involving the Mission Dolores area. He declined to comment on the memorial plan.<br><br>For now, it’s unclear whether Mission Dolores will be able to raise enough money to bring its indigenous dead back into the light. Donations of any amount are welcome, Galvan said. <br><br>Disclosure: Beth Winegarner donates a small amount of money each year to the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust and the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mission-dolores-curator-aims-to-humanize-sites-indigenous-dead/

San Francisco jail records reveal that Ellicott, 38, was booked at 9:07 this morning and is being held on $50,000 bail for his 62 felony charges.<br><br>He is accused of establishing a bogus company and using it to loot the very branch of the HR department that he was charged with keeping both technically and monetarily sound. <br><br>“The charges announced today reflect my office’s continuing commitment to uncover official misconduct in San Francisco’s City government,” District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement.  “My office would like to thank the Department of Human Resources for its swift and thorough cooperation in uncovering the depths of their trusted manager’s great betrayal.” <br><br>The January and March cases against Ellicott are unrelated, but it was the investigation into the former that led to today’s arrest and charging. In addition to allegedly selling high-end consumer electronics bought with emergency supply money, Ellicott was charged in January with participating in a larger municipal theft and kickback scheme operated by former Community Challenge Grant director Lanita Henriquez and former Gavin Newsom mayoral staffer, businessman and city fixer Dwayne Jones. <br><br>The District Attorney alleges that Jones’ company, RDJ Enterprises, paid Ellicott — a city employee at that time — nearly $270,000 over the course of four years. Ellicott then purportedly used Venmo and PayPal to funnel some $65,650 of Jones’ money to Henriquez. <br><br>In an affidavit released today, DA investigator Mike Reilly reveals that scrutiny of Ellicott’s financial transactions regarding the earlier case unearthed a “long series of unusual deposits” into his personal bank account totaling more than $450,000. These payments emanated from a source the DA refers to only as “Witness 1,” a Chicagoan. <br><br>Reilly reached “Witness 1,” who told him her old college pal Ellicott paid her $1,000 in 2019 to establish a company called IAG Services, and to set up a bank account for IAG services using her own name and information. She said Ellicott then took over the account. <br><br>Department of Human Resources managers confirmed to Reilly that Ellicott himself added IAG Services as a vendor into the city system in May 2019. Starting that month and continuing until January 2024 — the month of his prior arrest — more than $627,000 in payments were made from the city to IAG. These “appeared to be fraudulent payments related to otherwise legitimate workers’ compensation benefits.”<br><br>While these payments were ostensibly for “auditing services,” human resources managers told Reilly that no paperwork exists to indicate that any auditing services were actually performed. Ellicott’s former colleagues were unable to locate invoices for most of the payments to IAG, and those they did locate were all approved by Ellicott himself. <br><br>All told, the human resources department provided the DA with 643 workers’ comp claims billed to IAG. Most were billed just once, with a payment between $925 and $986. Between 2019 and January 2024, the total amount paid was $627,118.86. Email records indicate Ellicott either approved these payments himself, or asked colleagues to process them. <br><br>The DA investigator traced more than $450,400 in payments from IAG to Ellicott’s personal bank account over the course of four years. These semi-monthly payments were denoted “Direct Deposit [Witness 1] D BILL PMT BILL PMT.” It was this series of regular payments that first caught investigator Reilly’s eye.<br><br>Following Henriquez’s arrest in August 2023, these payments were purportedly redirected to a different account tied to Ellicott. All told, the DA claims more than $488,000 was transferred between IAG and multiple Ellicott accounts. <br><br>Ellicott began working for the city in 2012, with a brief hiatus between 2015 and 2016. He was a manager at the human resources department from 2017 until January 25 of this year, when he was placed on paid leave.<br><br>Transparent California lists Ellicott’s 2022 pay as $187,884, with benefits of $55,613, for a total compensation package of $243,496. His most recent position with the human resources department was “assistant director of finance and technology.” The human resources department describes his position as being “responsible for the financial integrity of the Workers’ Compensation Division” — the division he oversaw and allegedly looted.<br><br>The Department of Human Resources announced today that it has implemented new controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.<br><br>Ellicott’s 62 charges include grand theft, misappropriation of public money, insurance fraud and money laundering. He was arrested “without incident” this morning at his Oakland home, and will face arraignment tomorrow.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/stanley-ellicott-workers-comp/

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/
1ffe811f-a985-4c4d-9c9e-4917560bdfa5,news,richmond,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!<br><br>I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.<br><br>You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.<br><br>Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.<br><br>Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.<br><br>Vince Yuen

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
7ca6c0b2-090e-4a3a-835e-49291d052ca3,news,richmond,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

07dc64d3-619f-46b3-bef4-b1f8c4ebdba9,news,sunset,COMMENTARY,,"MARCH 18, 2024",Commentary: Mayor’s Upzoning Plans Will Damage SF’s Neighborhoods,,"The Mayor’s Upzoning Plans Will Deeply Damage SF’s Neighborhoods<br><br>Demolitions, speculations, and displacement are in store if the city moves forward with Breed’s approach.<br><br>By Dennis Antenore<br><br>“There is no logic that can be superimposed on the city; people make it, and it is to them, not buildings, that we must fit our plans.” – Jane Jacobs<br><br>“Some who are fortunate to have communities still do fight to keep them, but they have seldom prevailed. While people possess a community, they usually understand that they can’t afford to lose it, but after it is lost, gradually even the memory of what was lost is lost.” – Jane Jacobs<br><br> “If we wish to rebuild our cities, we must first rebuild our neighborhoods.” – Harvey Milk<br><br>The massive citywide rezoning proposed by the mayor and under consideration at the Planning Commission will have disastrous impacts on San Francisco and directly threatens our neighborhoods.<br><br>The state-mandated Housing Element of the General Plan calls for removing all density controls on lots in much of the western and central parts of the City, and dramatically increasing heights from between 65 feet to, in some cases, as high as 240 feet. These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected.

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/
8275c789-33d0-45fa-a819-e9ad817dc0bc,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.<br><br>You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.<br><br>Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.<br><br>Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community.

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/

Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

061c9613-0442-44be-9f2c-cc2976fcd317,news,sunset,FOOD,,"MARCH 6, 2024",Golden Boy Pizza’s New Location at Old Marco Polo Taraval Site,,"By John Ferrannini<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza, a popular North Beach neighborhood pizzeria known for its square slices of focaccia bread pizza, will be opening a new location at 1447 Taraval St. in the Sunset District.<br><br>The eatery will be coming to the Parkside neighborhood as early as mid-March, according to Julian Sodini, son of founder Peter Sodini.<br><br>The new location is in the former location of Marco Polo Italian Ice Cream, which will be relocating to 3886 Noriega St. in the spring.<br><br>“When my father (Peter) was head of the ship, when I was a kid, he expanded out to five or six locations, but we ended up returning back to the one (in North Beach),” Sodini said. “Now, we’re trying to expand again. Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

District 2 Supervisor Catherine Stefani recused herself from representation because her husband owns a boat in the marina. The grassroots group “Keep The Waterfront Open” collected more than 2,500 signatures opposing plans that would remove boats located at Gashouse Cove — part of the Marina Small Craft Harbor since the 1960s — so that PG&E can “decontaminate the water.” Along with removal of the wooden slips and the only public fuel dock in town, the view of bobbing masts would be gone forever.<br><br>Critics say the plan is really about the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department’s desire to accommodate much larger yachts, which would further restrict views from the Marina Green but would increase revenue flow to the agency, all while allowing PG&E to save millions by doing a less than adequate cleanup of its toxins under the water of the adjacent Gashouse Cove.<br><br>With Stefani abstaining, the city charter says “the privilege of the floor shall not be granted, for any purpose, to persons other than officers of the City or their duly authorized representatives.

Installations are expected to start in the summer.<br><br>Six speed cameras are proposed for Ingleside and nearby neighborhoods: Ocean Avenue from Friday Kahlo Way to Howth Street, San Jose Avenue from Santa Ynez Avenue to Ocean Avenue, Alemany Boulevard from Farragut Avenue to Naglee Avenue, Mission Street from Ottawa Avenue to Allison Street, Geneva Avenue from Prague Street to Brookdale Avenue and Monterey Boulevard from Edna Street to Congo Street.<br><br>“I think the ones that we ended up recommending are the ones that are definitely the strongest because I think this is an opportunity for us to change policy not only in San Francisco but in California,” Hake said.<br><br>Pedestrian and road safety is on NMTIA members’ minds following recent pedestrian fatalities by motor vehicles at the Alemany Boulevard and Rousseau Street intersection in February and the March 16 crash that killed three people beside West Portal Station on Saturday.<br><br>NMTIA recently welcomed a new traffic light at Alemany Boulevard and Theresa Street with other neighbors and District 11 Supervisor Ahsha Safaí on Feb. 24.<br><br>“That’s why the speed cameras, more than anything, are so important to pedestrian and people’s lives because every five to ten miles [per hour] you go up, the probability of death goes up dramatically,” Safaí said.<br><br>Several attendees asked about the cost of this project and how it would work for those caught speeding. Hake said it would be funded through the transportation agency’s operating budget to get a camera vendor and any revenue that is earned will initially go toward covering program costs with any additional income going towards traffic calming improvements.<br><br>Offenders would be charged a penalty at a cost of $50 to $500 depending on how many mph over the speed limit they drive. Violations would also be issued as civil penalties and treated more like tollbooth charges with the ticket going to the individual on the vehicle's registration.<br><br>Sam Thomas, who lives on San Jose Avenue, said a speed camera on Alemany Boulevard is “super important.”<br><br>“Alemany is super dangerous,” Thomas said. “We just had a neighbor who died on Cotter. It’s terrible. Alemany is a whole different beast.”<br><br>The speed camera proposal will go to the SFMTA Board of Directors in April and then on to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in June.",https://www.inglesidelight.com/speed-camera-installation-meeting/

Despite the bad weather, they had two volunteers participate and were able to plant five trees and landscape three areas.<br><br>“The event went great,” OAA’s Deputy Director Gabe Cory said. “It was a pleasure working with Climate Action Now to beautify three different areas along Ocean Avenue with trees and sidewalk gardens.”<br><br>The three landscaped areas were fitted with Catalina Ironwood trees and sidewalk gardens with flowers like coffee berry, manzanita, sage, California rye, silk tassel, South African lilies and more. The founding director of Climate Action Now, Markos Major, said they sourced the greenery from wholesale nurseries such as Pacific Nursery and Devil Mountain Wholesale Nursery.<br><br>Funding for this project also came from the Civic Joy Fund, a nonprofit spending $2 million to put some magic back into San Francisco’s commercial corridors following the slow recovery from the pandemic, Cory said.<br><br>Three trees and one sidewalk garden were placed on the block in front of The Fate Teahouse between Brighton and Lee avenues. One tree and a 20-25’ sidewalk garden were planted near the San Francisco Public Library’s Ingleside Branch. One tree and sidewalk garden were planted on Miramar Avenue toward the Westwood Park entrance.<br><br>“We hope this to be the beginning of a partnership with Ocean Avenue,” Major said. “There’s so much work to be done in our city. Increasing permeability, removing pavement and planting gardens is one of the greatest ways to support a healthy climate.”<br><br>This project is among the first of many, Cory said, with the next round of planting planned for the summer. Climate Action Now has also worked with nearby neighborhood organizations such as the Friends of Lakeside Village on similar volunteer opportunities. Major also said they are in talks with Java On Ocean to partner for their next neighborhood project.<br><br>“Something as small as planting a few trees and sidewalk gardens can make a big difference on the look and feel of a street,” Cory said. “We hope the community enjoys these new additions and they add more beauty to Ocean Avenue.”",https://www.inglesidelight.com/ingleside-ocean-avenue-trees-landscaping/
1aea2707-55b6-4dae-8362-dd5f6da5f247,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,YUJIE ZHOU,"MARCH 23, 2024, 3:01 PM",Mark Farrell’s pitch to voters? ‘Common sense.’,,"Three times within an hour, San Francisco mayoral hopeful Mark Farrell called on voters to use “common sense” to decide on their stance on city issues. <br><br>“San Francisco is moving away from just being ideological, this left and right, progressive and moderate,” Farrell said last night, to a sold-out crowd at Manny’s cafe in conversation with Mission Local’s managing editor, Joe Eskenazi. “Let’s just have common sense again.”<br><br>Farrell, like Daniel Lurie and Ahsha Safaí in earlier conversations, expressed his frustration with the city’s status quo, and strived to differentiate himself from the rest of the field, stacked with candidates who will be making their appeals to the same set of moderate voters. In particular, he proposed to remove all large homeless encampments in six months, wean downtown San Francisco off of its dependence on the tech industry, increase police staffing levels and open 24/7 clinics for drug users. <br><br>But, like others, he contrasted the San Francisco of today with earlier, better times. In the old days, if you told someone you were from San Francisco, said the 50-year-old San Francisco native, “It was met with a sense of awe, a sense of wonderment, even envy. And today you get, ‘Are you okay?’”<br><br>As he sees it, San Francisco’s public safety, street conditions and economy have never been worse. And that’s mostly due to a “plain and simply failed leadership,” said Farrell. San Francisco used to have more than 2,300 police officers when Ed Lee was the mayor and Farrell was a supervisor, he said. The same number now stands at 1,857, according to the police department. Farrell mentioned former District Attorney Chesa Boudin for demoralizing the police department. <br><br>“Since I left office, our population has declined,”  he said. “So inherently, crime should decline because of that on its face.”<br><br>The crime rate, however, did decline. San Francisco saw fewer cases of both property crimes and violent crimes in 2023 than 2018, the year Farrell left office. <br><br>“We need to have law enforcement in San Francisco, just on principle, to create a civil society, to make sure there is deterrent,” he said. “In San Francisco, at times in the past, that has been foreign. But I think it’s just common sense that needs to be brought back.”<br><br>Farrell argued that his 7.5 years at City Hall — seven years as District 2 supervisor and six months as mayor after Ed Lee died — had equipped him with “a consistent track record” that voters could predict his performance in office. <br><br>To him, Mayor London Breed’s track record has been inconsistent on a number of issues. Regarding the abandoned downtown, he said Breed’s ideas make the city look disorganized: “What we heard was week one, we’re going to build science labs. Week two, we’re going to build housing. Week three, it was a U.C. campus, and then it became a soccer stadium.” <br><br>Michael Petrelis, who is running for District 9 supervisor, disrupted the conversation early on from outside the cafe, holding a sign that read “Ban cars now!” and interjecting frequently. He blared criticisms of Farrell from a bullhorn, but the volume on the speakers’ microphones was turned up, and Petrelis left after some 20 minutes. (We reported earlier that Petrelis attempted to shut down the event and left because he was tired. Petrelis wrote in an email, “My goal was not to stop the conversation and my cameraman had to leave because he had a date. I didn’t leave because I was tired.”<br><br>Macy’s recent closure announcement “caught the mayor’s office off guard, and City Hall off guard,” said Farrell, who noted similar situations also happened with Nordstrom and the San Francisco Centre’s closure. <br><br>Farrell said Breed’s office does not have relationships with the city’s largest tenants, largest building owners and the equity and debt behind them. This situation wouldn’t have happened if he were mayor, he said. He wouldn’t have been blindsided, and would’ve brought everyone together and worked out a solution comprehensively, he said. <br><br>As for plans for a downtown recovery, Farrell said he would first focus on addressing public safety and street conditions, to create an environment where employers and employees would be willing to come back.<br><br>“Diversification” was his diagnosis for downtown in the long term. “You know, we were over-reliant on the tech industry,” said Farrell. <br><br>“To the point where everyone wore the same vest,” noted Eskenazi.<br><br>“I’m glad I didn’t wear mine tonight,” said Farrell, who sported a black suit and white button-down. He noted that the tech industry’s tendency to work from home has turned San Francisco’s downtown into a veritable ghost town. <br><br>How would the public sector fix things that it neither created nor broke? Eskenazi asked.<br><br>The power of tax incentives, Farrell answered. In 2011, Mayor Lee and the Board of Supervisors, including Farrell, managed to use tax breaks to attract Twitter to revitalize mid-Market. “But it didn’t work. We learned our lessons as well,” he said. <br><br>Twitter brought a Silicon Valley model campus to San Francisco, having an in-house gym, an in-house cafe and even in-house dry cleaning, which prevented the surrounding neighborhoods from benefiting much, he said. “If we do this again, we have to do it in a much different, much smarter way,” he said. <br><br>“I think unless we’re aggressive about [reviving downtown], we’re going to lose downtown forever in a potential way,” he said. <br><br>Farrell also wants cars back on Market Street. “Let’s just have common sense again,” he said. “At the end of the day, we have to admit that taking cars off Market Street, it’s not a panacea.”<br><br>“Market Street hasn’t been safer, statistically, since we took cars off Market Street,” Farrell said. <br><br>Contrasting Farrell’s citation of statistics regarding street safety — but not crime, in which people “feel” less safe in spite of statistically lower levels, Eskenazi quipped “But I feel safer.” <br><br>As for this week’s tragic car collision at West Portal which killed a family of four, Farrell said the lesson he drew was that the city should be “very granular” about every single intersection. He said he learned from friends who live in West Portal that, prior to the accident, the local community had sent multiple emails to the city saying it was a dangerous intersection, emails that went unheeded.<br><br>When asked who he would fire as mayor, Farrell mentioned the head of SFMTA, Jeffrey Tumlin, to promote public transportation, bicycling and pedestrian safety. In particular, he mentioned SFMTA’s L Taraval Project. “You tore up the street. You took away every single parking spot in the name of increasing the time or decreasing the time it will take for a trolley to get down the road and down. But you know what you’re also doing? Killing. You’re killing a lot of small businesses,” he said. <br><br>And Police Chief Bill Scott, whom Farrell called “a very good man” who had simply been in the position too long. “At the end of the day, the average tenure of a police chief in the U.S. is three years, and he has been here for almost eight,” Farrell said. <br><br>Farrell also intends to back city charter reform on November’s ballot, to guarantee the mayor always has the power to fire or hire department heads in a “plain and simple” way. This week, Farrell created a political action committee to push two ballot measures that would do just that, while also allowing the mayoral candidate to seek unlimited campaign donations to ostensibly back those ballot measures.<br><br>Asked whether he would support Breed’s recent veto of Board President Aaron Peskin’s legislation limiting density in areas of his district, Farrell said he would.<br><br>“I need you to speak loudly so the people in District 2 can hear you,” Eskenazi said. Would they want 270-foot high-rises in their neighborhoods? <br><br>It’s not about housing, but about “sloppy legislation” inside City Hall, said Farrell. “We had last summer’s density increases that everyone agreed upon. We come a few months later and say, ‘Whoops, I didn’t mean that we’re going to density decrease.’”<br><br>Farrell sought to sidestep a pro-housing or anti-housing characterization, falling back on his “common sense” pitch.<br><br>“Where is this common sense, once again?” said Farrell. “This gets back to the YIMBY, NIMBY, different sides of the aisle, where it’s just a zero-sum game and somebody has to win. Unless you’re fully with us, you’re off the boat.”<br><br>“I do not believe that we need to upzone every single neighborhood in San Francisco,” he added, saying it is the wrong approach. “As is the approach to say that we’re not going to build anywhere in San Francisco. We can do it in a very smart manner.”<br><br>Farrell also promised to take out all the large homeless encampments in six months by offering residents shelter, which he did as mayor in 2018, he said. <br><br>He suggested having clinics for substance use care open 24/7. “We have to capture [drug users] when they’re willing to make a different decision. And to give them a chance for a better life,” he said.<br><br>And, on Day One, he would audit all of the San Francisco nonprofits working on homelessness, because the city is funding a large amount of overlapping services, he said. There could be as many as nine city departments that fund homeless spending, he said. “Many fund the same nonprofit, but don’t realize that they’re doing it, and have different metrics for how they’re measuring success.”<br><br>Asked which past mayor he would seek to emulate, Farrell pointed to traits of several different city leaders. Farrell appreciated former Mayor Willie Brown’s ability to simply get things done, he said, and Gavin Newsom’s bold approach to politics and policy. He aspired to Ed Lee’s patience and Dianne Feinstein’s genuine love of San Francisco. <br><br>He chose not to answer who his ranked-choice alliance would be, saying it was premature, but acknowledged that it would be a part of any mayoral candidate’s strategy. <br><br>If elected, Farrell, who was the longest-serving Board of Supervisors budget chair in San Francisco’s history, will also be one of the first — if not the first — mayors of a major American city who is a venture capitalist. His finance background, he said, would be “super relevant” to the fate of San Francisco, a city that has a projected budget deficit of $728 million in fiscal year 2024 and 2025, and a 36 percent office-vacancy rate. <br><br>“It is amazing to me that what City Hall is turning to is just a blame game … No one’s willing to take leadership and accountability,” he said. “We need that back in San Francisco if we’re going to bring our city back.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/mark-farrells-common-sense/

0374396a-c759-44d5-9573-ab1197b748e4,news,mission,RESTAURANT REVIEWS,MARIA C. ASCARRUNZ,"MARCH 23, 2024, 6:40 AM","Review: Foliage, Precita Park spot offering prix fixe menu, can do better",,"Foliage opened in October 2023 in the space vacated by Michelin-starred Marlena, which has since moved to Japantown as the already acclaimed Adams 7 — Japantown’s gain, our loss. <br><br>Foliage owners Stephane Roulland and Julia Indovina brought in Chef Mo Béjar to the beautiful corner space by Precita Park. When my editor asked me to review the new restaurant at their publicist’s request, I was salivating at the prospect of trying another somewhat affordable ($75) prix-fixe menu in the area. Béjar hails from the Central Valley, and his dishes have the requisite farm-to-table, sustainable and beautiful aesthetic, and they sounded interesting and fresh, with a few culinary twists and turns. <br><br>We started out with the house-made milk bread with cultured butter. The other option was the bread with a spiced salt and Spanish jamón, but we went for the basic. <br><br>This gorgeous golden orb came to the table, warm and inviting, with a very generous slab of butter, gleaming with crystals of crunchy salt. Plenty for us to have two wedges apiece, the interior was fluffy and yeasty, and gave us high hopes for the rest of the meal. Besides, who ever gives you enough butter with your bread? <br><br>The prix-fixe menu at Foliage offers two options per course, plus some optional add-ons. We decided to get each of the options, so that we would get to taste everything.<br><br>First course: Amberjack crudo with lacto-fermented pineapple, banana, macadamia nuts, and thinly sliced kohlrabi. <br><br>The vegetarian option: Avocado with essentially the same ingredients.<br><br>Both had a little funk, with an inexplicable paprika oil at the bottom of the bowls. The amberjack was lovely, but it was an odd combination of flavors; banana and fish connote a somewhat Caribbean vibe, but it didn’t really work for us. We were also a bit puzzled about the choice to take the same ingredients and simply substitute avocado for the protein. It seemed to me that here was a perfect, missed opportunity to make a wholly different, inventive vegetarian option. While we weren’t thrilled with the amberjack dish, the vegetarian option was lackluster. <br><br>Second course: Shrimp toast and ricotta gnocchi.<br><br>Beautiful dishes, both. The Foliage shrimp toast was wonderful; super crispy, light, highly spiced, with a Sichuan peppercorn aioli, and perfectly cooked shrimp. I’d get it again (and, in fact, I did). Our only quibble was the Osetra caviar was wasted on this. You literally could not taste it with everything else going on.<br><br>The gnocchi dish came with a lovely gorgonzola sauce, pooled under beautifully wilted and browned sweet cabbage, topped with fried sage and toasted nuts. Unfortunately, the cabbage was the best thing on the plate; the ricotta gnocchi themselves were severely tough and dense. We found them inedible, and when the runner eventually came around to ask if he could take the plate (without asking why the dish was untouched), I told him that the gnocchi were very hard. He apologized profusely and said he would tell the chef. When he returned, he informed us the chef admitted that they were usually softer, and asked if we wanted him to try making them again, or did we want another shrimp toast? Perhaps we should have taken him up on the offer for a re-do, but we took the safe-bet toast. My question is: How does that go out to a table? And were others eating those heavy gnocchi without complaint?<br><br>At that point, the courses seemed to have slowed down. I’d finished a glass of Cremant bubbly, and asked the runner for the list so I could order a glass of wine. He misheard me, and brought another glass of the same sparkling wine. He apologized, and began to take it back, but my sister said she would just take it so it wouldn’t go to waste. She hadn’t planned on having alcohol with dinner. I ordered a very good cabernet.<br><br>Next came our entrée courses. The options were local cod over sweet potato puree with fava greens and charred leeks, or roasted cauliflower with a vadouvan crema for the vegetarian dish. Or, for an additional $15, a coulotte steak (described by our server as “the best cut, the top of the sirloin.”) with mole, chayote, citrus, and chocolate jus. Sold! We ordered the fish and the steak.<br><br>The cod was a bit on the small side, slightly overdone, the skin could have been a little crisper for my taste, but overall had good flavor. The underlying sweet potato puree and leeks were good, the garum (an ancient Roman fish sauce) very subtle. I was busy eating my portion of the fish before switching off with my sister, so I didn’t notice she was having trouble with the steak.<br><br>When they first put the dish on the table, I asked if the thin brown sauce underneath the steak was the mole, and our runner said no, that’s the chocolate jus. A minute later, the chef himself came by with an extra little ramekin of the orange mole, which had been hiding under the chayote. A nice gesture, though I hadn’t asked for more; I just hadn’t seen it on the plate. We chatted with Chef Béjar a few minutes, asked where he’d cooked before, wished him well. <br><br>The steak was rare (which we both like), and I finally noticed my sister sawing away at the meat for an interminable amount of time. She looked at me in disbelief. “You need to cut this into really small pieces, or you won’t be able to chew it.” I tried my hand at it and, sure enough, it took at least 10 seconds to hack free a tiny piece, and then another 10 to chew it until it was soft enough to swallow. Again, we just could not eat it. The Foliage mole itself was — sorry, the only word I can think of is strange — citrusy, and unlike any other mole I’d ever had. The chayote was hard and flavorless. Our server finally came by and asked us how we were enjoying the course as she stared at the full plate. I demonstrated how hard it was to cut through the meat. She replied, “Yes, because it’s a very chewy cut.” Before I could show my amazement at this explanation, she quickly asked if she should take it away and I said “yes, please.”<br><br>In all the time I’ve been reviewing for Mission Local, I really can’t remember sending a dish back, much less two in one meal. By this point, we were looking around at the quite full restaurant and wondering if it was just us? We’re normally not that picky (in fact, I often get accused of liking everything indiscriminately), and we don’t relish making a scene. It was baffling, as no one else seemed to be having an issue, but seemed to be enjoying their meals thoroughly. <br><br>Dessert course: One was a mango semifreddo with tuile crumbles, a little mango jelly, and mint. <br><br>“Semifreddo” means “partially frozen.” The ice cream here, unfortunately, was a solid disk, and we had to wait a bit for it to soften. It tasted fine, however; very subtly mango flavored. <br><br>The other dessert was a white chocolate panna cotta with huckleberries. The panna cotta was nicely creamy and, thankfully, not too sweet. All in all, there was nothing wrong with the desserts; they were simply unremarkable.<br><br>And the perfect ending to our meal? As I reached for the bill, my hand hit my glass which still had some wine in it — only my second glass of the evening, mind you — and in dramatic fashion knocked it onto the table, smashing it loudly, flinging wine and bits of glass everywhere. A shard actually drew blood from my sister’s hand. Mortified, I now saw myself through the eyes of our servers and chef: “Oh, was that the drunk woman who complained about everything?” I apologized over and over, all were gracious, mopping up the mess and making light of the incident. The Foliage staff handled it with class and kindness.<br><br>They also graciously took the $15 steak off our bill without my asking, charged us for the wine that was a mistake (which, yes, we’d drank), and handed us a bill for close to $250. <br><br>It truly pains me to write a review like this. Anyone can make a mistake; a bad dish can happen to any kitchen, but don’t send it out. If a cut of beef is so chewy, cook it some other way. The deficiencies in the dishes we disliked were basic errors in execution. I know it is an excruciatingly difficult thing to open, run, and maintain a restaurant for any length of time, in this city, or anywhere. What a feather in Chef Béjar’s cap to have opened in this lovely space, with a ready-made clientele mourning the loss of their beloved Marlena. (NB: I never told anyone at the restaurant that I was reviewing that night, even though we’d been asked to do so.)<br><br>I’m hoping this was simply an anomaly, as I’m rooting for Chef Béjar to achieve success in that space, and for Foliage to become a neighborhood mainstay, as I’m sure the Precita Park community is hoping as well. <br><br>Foliage SF (website)

Parents and teachers, fearing the district was phasing out the K-8 model, immediately launched an advocacy effort, with around 100 of them showing up at two school district meetings to make impassioned pleas.  <br><br>Just as they were anxiously anticipating the worst news on March 22, when school budgets were due, they instead discovered that three of the four K-8s they advocated for dodged some or all of the proposed cuts.<br><br>San Francisco Community School, a K-8 in the Excelsior, was going to lose its only middle-school physical education teacher and a campus security position for the coming school year. Days after advocates participated in their second school district meeting on March 13, the district let them know that both positions would come back, according to Maia Piccagli, president of the school’s Parent Action Council.<br><br>She wasn’t quite sure exactly why, but thought it had something to do with their advocacy. “I felt amazing, I felt really excited. Honestly, I’ve done a lot of advocacy in my life, but I have rarely seen an immediate change,” she said. “It felt great to have had so many parents involved in making statements and having there be such a quick win afterwards.”<br><br>“We are happy to hear that SFUSD leadership is receiving and applying feedback,” said Frank Lara, executive vice president of United Educators of San Francisco, in a statement.<br><br>The school district, while emphasizing it is “committed to a transparent process for school staffing and budget allocation,” did not specify how the decision had been made.<br><br>SoMa’s Bessie Carmichael School PreK-8 Filipino Education Center also got what its parents and teachers advocated for: The reinstatement of one of the school’s two social workers, who the school district was going to cut. The good news came last Thursday morning — less than two days after the school board meeting, according to the school community. <br><br>Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School’s parents and teachers advocated for seven teaching positions the district had put on the block.  <br><br>The community learned early last week that the school district would reinstate two of their campus security positions, according to principal Claudia Delarios-Moran, who remains uncertain of the reason. These are necessary positions for the school, parents and teachers said, which the school had planned to hire at its own expense in the coming school year.<br><br>While the school district declined to add back the seven teaching positions, the money Buena Vista Horace Man will be able to save from spending on two campus security positions will be used to hire an extra teacher, reducing the casualties from seven to six. The school plans to hire a teacher to help with its fourth and fifth grades with the $157,000 saved, according to Delarios-Moran.<br><br>“I feel relieved, because it allows us to cut one less position,” said Delarios-Moran. “It gets us closer to where we were before in the first place.”<br><br>Twin Peaks’ Rooftop School TK-8 was not as fortunate. The school district informed the school in early March that it would lose one of its kindergarten positions. The school community made comments at the March 4 district advisory meeting, but didn’t show up at the following week’s school board meeting.<br><br>The position was not reinstated.<br><br>“They did not give us our kindergarten class back,” Rooftop Principal Darren Kawaii said last Friday. Kawaii also said he did not know how such decisions were made. <br><br>They might “get it back” the year after, he said, “but it’s not confirmed.” <br><br>Parents and teachers want assurances that “we will definitely get our kindergarten [teacher] back next year,” Kawaii added, but the district “won’t put it in writing whether it’s happening or not.”<br><br>The school district will start discussing school consolidation and closures this Thursday at a virtual town hall. At present, there are eight K-8 schools in San Francisco. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/some-k-8-schools-get-staffers-back-after-advocacy/

The 20-year-old is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl earlier this month while he was employed as an after-school worker at Everett Middle School.<br><br>San Francisco Superior Court Judge Brian L. Ferrall also determined that the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>Reyes, a worker with the nonprofit Mission Graduates’ after-school program, was arrested on March 5 at Everett Middle School following alleged improper contact with a student. He has been in custody since the arrest. <br><br>On March 11, Reyes pleaded not guilty to all charges during his arraignment. His maximum time in prison would be 14 years for the charges, which include three counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, unlawful sexual intercourse and contact with a minor for sexual offense, according to court documents. <br><br>A preliminary hearing was held today in Department 13 on the second floor of the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant St. Only Reyes’ mother and two other family members were in the courtroom’s audience. <br><br>Reyes showed up in an orange jumpsuit and smiled when saw his family members. Throughout the two-hour hearing, Reyes repeatedly looked back to exchange glances with his family, especially his mother. At one point, Reyes mouthed “Love you” to his mother, who nodded in response. <br><br>Deputy public defender Semuteh Freeman, who represents Reyes, said her client was comfortable participating in the hearing in English until a Spanish interpreter was available, saying that Reyes attended school and was educated in English from the age of 13. Two interpreters arrived in the second hour of the hearing and began interpreting the proceedings for Reyes.<br><br>Prosecutor Tanisha Gooch summoned two witnesses today: A San Francisco police officer and a sergeant, who both had first-hand information regarding the case. <br><br>Officer Bryan Santan responded with his partner to the initial call at 12:45 p.m. on March 5 . He spoke with both Principal Alicia Blacknell and the alleged victim in the principal’s office at Everett Middle School. <br><br>Santana said the victim and Reyes had known each other for several months before the alleged rape. They had kissed several times prior to March 5, but had not had a prior sexual relationship. While Santana continued to describe details of the alleged rape, Reyes shook his head. <br><br>The purported victim took the bus to 16th and Mission streets, and then walked to meet Reyes at his nearby apartment, where the alleged rape took place, according to what Santana learned. The victim went to school after leaving Reyes’ apartment. Later, she felt physical pain and messaged Reyes. <br><br>While being interviewed by Officer Santana on March 5, Blacknell identified Reyes as the “boyfriend” the victim had mentioned to her. Santana also identified Reyes in the courtroom today.<br><br>On March 5, the alleged victim told Santana, a certified Spanish translator, that her communication with Reyes was in Spanish. Santana saw several screenshots of the victim’s text messages, in Spanish, with Reyes. He told the court that the principal showed him the screenshots, and he saw them again later after obtaining the alleged victim’s phone. <br><br>Both public defender Freeman and officer Santana agreed today that the resolution of the screenshots presented as exhibits in court today was so low that they were not legible. Still, Santana described what he could remember of the text messages.<br><br>He saw messages, including heart-shaped emojis, in Instagram DMs. He also recalled seeing the background photo of the alleged victim and Reyes’ WhatsApp exchange, which he said both sides could see: “The photo behind the entire series of texts that I was shown appeared to be the victim in a bra, wearing a small pair of jean shorts, looking away from the camera,” Santana said.<br><br>He also recalled the 12-year-old and Reyes calling each other pet names, saying “I love you,” and sending emojis of heart shapes and kisses. Once, Reyes even sent a Spanish sentence that could be roughly translated as “I wanna eat you up,” according to Santana.<br><br>But not every communique between the alleged victim and Reyes was so light. When the 12-year-old informed Reyes of being in pain after sexual intercourse, court documents list his responses as, “I’m sorry for being so hard” and “It only hurts the first time.” <br><br>Santana acknowledged that neither he nor his partner turned their body camera on when they interviewed the 12-year-old on March 5, because of the police department’s policy on such cameras.<br><br>The second witness, Sergeant Daniel Kelly, was assigned the case on March 5, and spoke to the alleged victim about Reyes that evening. According to Kelly, she first met Reyes in late 2023, months before Reyes started working in the after-school program at Everett. When the alleged rape occurred on March 5, the victim was aware that Reyes was working at Everett, and that day was her first visit to Reyes’ apartment.<br><br>Kelly said the 12-year-old named three platforms on which she and Reyes had been communicating: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. The girl’s phone has been turned over to the Crime Scene Investigation’s multimedia evidence unit.<br><br>Kelly also interviewed Reyes at Mission Station on March 5 and described Reyes as “calm.” Reyes said he taught art and coached sixth, seventh and eighth grade soccer at Everett. Reyes, who has a young child of his own, said he believed the victim was approximately 16 years old. He also said they were in love with each other; “that nobody has ever made him feel the way Jane Doe has,” said Kelly.  <br><br>He said “other female students [at Everett] had been essentially throwing themselves at him in a romantic sense, trying to give him hugs, trying to locate him on social media, messaging him [so much] that he had to regularly rebuff them,” said Kelly, recounting a conversation with Reyes.<br><br>Reyes acknowledged that he knew the victim was too young to have a sexual relationship with him, Kelly testified.<br><br>Kelly has had difficulty locating the address of the apartment where the alleged rape took place. According to the sergeant, Reyes provided one address, while Kelly and his team found another. <br><br>The victim received medical care at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. <br><br>Reyes has been held in jail without bail. “The Defendant is an employee at a middle school, and thus surrounded by potential future victims,” the District Attorney’s Office argued in court documents. <br><br>Attorneys of both parties and Judge Ferrall discussed whether Reyes should be moved to home detention, which Ferrall later dismissed, citing a public-safety risk.<br><br>Public defender Freeman said that, while Reyes did have a prior misdemeanor conviction in Richmond when he was 18, he has no other criminal record. Freeman said he has been shuttled in and out of foster care facilities since he was 13. Once Reyes was incarcerated, he lost the funds to pay rent for his apartment.<br><br>“I’m asking the court to consider the effect of prolonged incarceration on him. I do think that there are other non-carceral ways that the court can ensure public safety,” said Freeman. “I don’t think he’s a flight risk, both because we have a default here, but also because he has a child and mother, and he is co-parenting his child.”<br><br>Freeman also noted that the Central American Resource Center of Northern California has been working with Reyes and his mother on asylum claims.<br><br>“The people are concerned about public safety,” prosecutor Gooch argued. “He’s making comments that the young girls at this middle school who are in grades six through eight, are throwing themselves at him. He acknowledged during his interview that he knew what he was doing was wrong, that the victim was too young, but he did it anyway, because that’s how love works.”<br><br>“I agree he’s not a flight risk, but the risk to public safety, from the evidence I’ve heard, is severe,” said Ferrall, who said the material presented today in court was “extremely troubling.” <br><br>“I can’t say that I’m comfortable with a less restrictive alternative of home detention, given what’s happened, and none of which would have been prevented by him being on electronic monitoring in his apartment,” he added, adding that the fact that the alleged rape happened at Reyes’ home rendered home detention a risk.<br><br>The judge also mentioned that Reyes has inflicted a potentially lifetime impact on the alleged victim. He also found Reyes’ comments of other girls at Everett throwing themselves at him troubling.<br><br>Ferrall discharged the felony charge of sodomy of a person under 18 for lack of evidence. Five felony charges remain.<br><br>After the decisions were made, Reyes broke into tears, lowering his head while his shoulders shook uncontrollably. Reyes’ mother, whose eyes were red from a morning of crying, called out words of encouragement to Reyes in Spanish. <br><br>Ferrall also determined that he had seen enough evidence for Reyes to be held to answer, and the case will move forward to trial in early April.<br><br>The court has prohibited Reyes from coming within 150 yards of the victim or having electronic, written or telephonic contact with the victim, or contacting the victim through a third party other than the attorney.  ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/everett-after-school-worker-accused-of-rape-remains-incarcerated-troubling-material-emerges-in-court/

e721c6e3-1bc3-42ea-97cf-af7fdcaf88e2,news,mission,ELECTION COVERAGE,JOE ESKENAZI,"MARCH 25, 2024, 5:30 AM",‘Moderate-on-moderate violence:’ SF mayoral race’s next act,,"Do you know how many votes you get to cast for mayor in November? If so, you’re better informed than many of the folks working this year’s mayoral campaigns — or running in them — who tend to default to ‘a lot.’ <br><br>They’re not wrong, but the Department of Elections informs us that the exact answer is 10. Ten! Can you imagine it? Can you envision the thought process behind parsing your sixth, seventh and eighth choices? It’d be like asking Elizabeth Taylor to rank her ex-husbands (and Liz would complicate her ballot by putting Richard Burton twice). <br><br>Will most San Francisco voters dutifully fill out all 10 spots? Of course not; that’d be a lot to expect out of a voter, especially when, like the roster of a city Little League team, the talent level among the mayoral candidates really drops off after the top four or five. <br><br>So, no, most San Francisco voters will not emulate David Letterman and craft their own Top-10 lists. But the vast majority will be voting for multiple candidates, as the system allows. The national ranked-choice voting advocacy group Fair Vote crunched 20 years of San Francisco data, and noted that the median number of city voters who’ve been opting for multiple candidates is 74 percent. <br><br>That’s a lot of extra votes out there. Candidates neglecting, ignoring or disdaining the voting system we’ve had in place since 2004 are setting themselves up to be neglected, ignored or disdained. And yet, it happens more than you’d think. <br><br>With the dust settling from the March 5 election, we’re entering into a period of what one pithy city player calls “moderate-on-moderate violence.” <br><br>Up in the political heavens, our Masters of the Universe are turning on one another. Some of the billionaires will support the incumbent. But some won’t: Don’t look now, but Mark Farrell established a candidate-controlled committee last week to push the mayoral-strengthening ballot measures from Michael Moritz’s TogetherSF … which also enables Farrell to raise unlimited funds. <br><br>On a more terrestrial plane, the competition for mayoral endorsements will be fierce. And multifaceted. This is a multi-front war. It will be fought over the now moderate-heavy Democratic County Central Committee, the big-money groups spending with sailor-on-liberty ferocity over the last several election cycles, neighborhood and ethnic Democratic clubs, and influential and quasi-influential individuals. When it comes to bending the ears of individual DCCC member-elects, we’re told, “the wooing season has already started.” <br><br>Mayor London Breed’s team has, additionally, made it clear that it is not interested in any dual or ranked endorsements. This is a loaded decree coming from a sitting mayor who’ll be running this town for the next eight-odd months (and may yet win in November). It’d be nice if she picked up the phone for you, right? Political and governmental issues aren’t supposed to bleed into one another, but it often happens here on planet Earth.  <br><br>At this point, this is just a battle over endorsements. Breed’s demand that she and she alone be recognized makes political sense. It does not benefit her to have other people’s names and photos on the campaign brochures she’d rather have featuring her and her alone. That’s hardly unwise or crazy. <br><br>But there’s a difference between consolidating endorsements for a campaign and actually running a campaign. And, at this point, everything seems to point toward the mayor having little interest in engaging with the ranked-choice strategy that has governed San Francisco elections for a generation and will decide this one, whether she likes it or not. <br><br>Do you know what percentage of the time the candidate who wins the most first-place votes goes on to win in a ranked-choice election? According to the data sets over at Fair Vote, it’s around 94 percent. Didn’t Mayor Breed finish first in a 2018 election in which she put minimal effort into a ranked-choice strategy, and then hang on to beat Mark Leno and Jane Kim, who put a maximal effort into such a strategy? Yes, that happened. So what’s the big deal? <br><br>Let’s address the higher-end issue first. Many elections, if not most, are not particularly competitive. If we had a ranked-choice contest on what to have for dinner and the choices were pizza, haggis or Scandinavian aspic, the permutations of RCV would not likely come into play. <br><br>And that leads to the forthcoming San Francisco mayoral election — and how, in some ways, it’s 180 degrees different than the race Breed won in 2018. One thing it certainly isn’t is a pizza-haggis-aspic competition. It seems plain that this one is going to be competitive, and the notion of any of the declared candidates amassing a double-digit first-round lead, as Breed did in 2018, feels more than a bit fanciful. It certainly doesn’t feel like a solid assumption that our deeply unpopular incumbent mayor, who is running in the same ideological lane as two other well-financed competitors, is a lock to finish first at all. <br><br>In that 2018 contest, Leno and Kim each garnered about 60,000 first-place votes. That was a good 30,000 behind Breed — but, combined, the two outpolled her handily. Over the course of eight rounds of ranked-choice tabulations, Leno gained on Breed, eventually losing by just 2,500-odd votes, a 50.55 to 49.45 tilt. <br><br>In 2024, we won’t have two candidates neatly splitting the pie among voters less ideologically inclined to vote for Breed. Rather, now we’ll have multiple candidates on her side of the sandbox, splitting her voters. There is, clearly, a big center-left lane in which to run. Aaron Peskin is biding his time like Godot — And if he doesn’t come? We’ll come back tomorrow. And then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. But it figures he will eventually arrive. Perhaps as soon as April. <br><br>Peskin is in no hurry. Why interrupt this moderate-on-moderate violence? But when he does finally enter, a ranked-choice strategy among his mayoral competitors would seem to be de rigueur. But it remains to be seen if these candidates can get over individual ambitions and personal animosity to agree on anything. Election professionals worry that these sorts of deals, at least early in the election cycle, project weakness. They also give your chosen voter base tacit permission to vote for another candidate. <br><br>Election professionals, however, also know the value of (eventually) forming alliances. Candidates, though, often don’t; candidates can be the most inconvenient part of the electoral process for election professionals. So can voters, who are less ideological than political insiders and, messaging be damned, vote for candidate combinations that don’t make intuitive sense. One casualty of moderate-on-moderate violence may be punch-drunk voters. <br><br>“There should be genuine concern about confusing voters,” a moderate operative tells me. <br><br>Ranked-choice voting needn’t be confusing, but politics often is. In 2018, even up to the penultimate seventh round of ranked-choice tabulations, Kim and Leno held nearly 57 percent of the vote. The electorate, at that time, was clearly leaning progressive, so multiple progressives entered the fray, split the vote, diluted their collective leverage, and the mayoral contest was won by a moderate. It’s funny how that works. <br><br>This year, the electorate would seem to be leaning moderate. And, lo, multiple moderates have entered the fray. Moderates have the clear advantage — and, as a result of that, every individual candidate is incentivized to stay in the race, work for his or her own benefit, and dilute their collective leverage. It has the potential to work out funny again.<br><br>Regardless, it will be fascinating to see what comes next — if not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow. Possibly. And so on. ",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/moderate-on-moderate-violence-sf-mayoral-races-next-act/

Meet Chester Moody.<br><br>It’s 1958 in the Jim Crow South: Lorman, Mississippi, to be precise. He is 17 years old, attending Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, a historically black college, and he is in excruciating pain. At the administration office, he is told it will be 21 days before a dentist visits the college, and Black students can’t leave campus.<br><br>So, young Chester Moody broke into the campus woodshop, borrowed a pair of pliers, and performed his own extraction.<br><br>“It took me a while to get the courage, but the moment I clamped the pliers around that molar, the pain went away,” recalls Moody, 84, from his dental lab on the 16th floor of the downtown Sutter Street Medical/Dental Building, where he fabricates dental prosthetics, including dentures, implants and more. “I now know that it was the gas escaping, but I couldn’t walk around with pliers coming out of my mouth. I was screwing up my courage to pull, and suddenly there was a snap and the top part of the tooth was gone! Oh, the smell was terrible, but the relief was instant.”<br><br>Born in 1939 in Coffeeville, Mississippi, Moody studied to be a teacher. “In those days in the South, there were two professions open to Black men: You could be a preacher or a teacher.”<br><br>He planned to teach industrial arts because, hey, he could sure wield those pliers. <br><br>Dentistry had never entered his mind. <br><br>Now, in life, there are all kinds of luck: Dumb luck and blind luck, bad luck and good luck and hard luck. In Chester Moody’s life, three lucky breaks changed his destiny. <br><br>The first: After graduating from Alcorn College in 1960, he went to St. Paul, Minnesota, to visit family. “Now, my aunt was taking my cousins to get their teeth cleaned, and she said, “You come too, Chester,” and we got there, to the Mayo Clinic, and this dentist did the exam after my cleaning and said, ‘Whoever extracted that back molar did a terrible job, he left the root tips in.’ I laughed and told him that was me.” <br><br>That dentist, Dr. Louie T. Austin, was the director of dental services at the Mayo Clinic, and “he fell in love with me for my story,” Moody recalls. “He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.”<br><br>Dr. Austin offered Moody a job in his lab, and taught him the trade. “This guy was the greatest teacher in the world. That’s where I got started, in the laboratory, and fell in love with it. “<br><br>Moody worked for Dr. Austin a few years, until he was drafted into the United States Army.<br><br>“I was going to defect to Canada, but my mom wept and wept, and so I said I wouldn’t go, and reluctantly stepped over the line.”<br><br>And here comes the second piece of luck. “I finished basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and was scheduled to be sent to North Carolina to learn artillery. Three days before I was supposed to go, I get called into the orderly room where you get your orders.”<br><br>Even today, 60 years later, his face beams with delight as he quotes his commanding officer: “Private Moody, your orders have been changed. You are going to SAN FRANCISCO, to LETTERMAN GENERAL HOSPITAL. They need a dental technician.”  <br><br>He said he stopped listening after “San Francisco,” because he was so excited. He and a buddy had been planning a cross-country trip out here. “I called Jim immediately and I said, ‘Guess what? I am going to San Francisco, and my ticket is being paid by YOUR UNCLE!  Your UNCLE SAM!’”  <br><br>The staff dental technician at Letterman was being sent to Vietnam, and Moody was his replacement.<br><br>Moody arrived in San Francisco in February 1963. <br><br>He lived in barracks at the Presidio. “Imagine waking up every morning and out your window, YOUR WINDOW, you are looking at the prettiest sight you ever saw, the Golden Gate Bridge.”<br><br>On weekends, he and his buddies explored California. “We went north, we went all along the south coast, we went east. Oh, I was in the service, yes, but I was enjoying EVERY MINUTE OF IT!“<br><br>Even today, after 60 years in San Francisco, Moody’s speech is molasses-thick with the cadences of Mississippi. His manner is courtly, and he is sturdily built, with powerful arms and hands. He looks much younger than his 84 years, and he often cracks up when he tells his story.<br><br>He had always intended to return to Minnesota after his service, but he met his wife, Georgette, in San Francisco.  “There were two ladies in the waiting room at the dental clinic at Letterman, and I overheard them discussing issues with their daughters. I went up and said, ‘Tell you what, you give me your daughters’ phone numbers and I’ll take them out and tell you what’s up with them!’ One lady sniffed, ‘NO WAY!’ but the other lady gave me Georgette’s number.”<br><br>They met in February 1965, and were married that May. Though they divorced in 1980, they remain good friends and have three children, now in their 50s, seven grandchildren and two great-grandkids. His second marriage, to Cora, born in Mississippi like himself, “and the world’s greatest cook,” lasted until her death in 2008.  <br><br>Coming out of the army, he recalls, “I rented a two-bedroom on Golden Gate and Steiner for $135 a month, and got a job right away” at $75 a week at Pacific West Lab, in the building where he works today. “I told the owner I would only work there till the snow melts in Minnesota.”<br><br>Moody smiles, “I tell people the snow never melted, so I stayed in San Francisco.” <br><br>Pacific West Lab was busy. A hundred dental technicians worked there. Hawaii had no lab back then, so they also serviced all the dentists in Hawaii.<br><br>“Every Monday, three gigantic mailbags arrived from Hawaii, filled with dentures that needed fixing.”<br><br>Except for a few years at a lab in Oakland, Moody has worked at 450 Sutter his whole career. <br><br>And now, the third great stroke of luck: A friendship that lasted 60 years and changed his life. Roman Braunfeld was a Polish Jew, a holocaust survivor. He weighed 60 pounds, had TB, and was almost dead when the U.S. Army liberated Buchenwald, where he was a prisoner. One of the American soldiers who rescued him was a Black sergeant, also named Chester. <br><br>Braunfeld recovered in Switzerland, learned the dental technology trade, married, and emigrated to the United States in 1953.<br><br>Moody and Braunfeld had an instant rapport, a deep and abiding mutual respect. They worked together until their lab was bought out. Braunfeld left and started his own lab, Far West Dental, in 1970, on another floor; Moody followed shortly.<br><br>In addition to a thriving business, Braunfeld did pro bono work for those who couldn’t afford it, including recovering addicts at Delancey Street who had lost teeth to drugs.<br><br>They worked together until Braunfeld’s death in 2016. In 2006, Braunfeld sold the lab to Moody and his coworker, Lily Louie, age 65. Today, the pair work full time and employ four to five people, but it’s increasingly hard to find skilled craftspeople. The City College program from which Lily Louie graduated 40 years ago has closed. Much of the work is sent to China and other overseas labs, according to Moody.<br><br>Moody ‘s small studio is a throwback to an earlier time.<br><br>To get business, he goes around the building and visits patients in their dentists’ chairs. “I see 12 to 14 patients a day: I match tooth color, I design partials, and sometimes their dentures aren’t fitting right and the dentist will say, ‘Well, what can we do here, Chet?’“<br><br>Moody takes great pride and pleasure in his work. He sees it as a public service and an art. He tells the story of a 19-year-old patient, born with a terrible cleft palate. Moody manufactured an upper denture that was flexible enough to fold up to squeeze through the tight opening of his mouth. <br><br>“I have incredible non-book knowledge that Dr. Austin taught me,” he says. “For instance, take your two front teeth. I was taught that from the top of your head to the bottom of your chin, the length of the front teeth should be one-sixteenth of that measurement. Back in the ’60s, you could get dentists to give you that measurement for a patient, but they don’t do that anymore.”<br><br>When asked about retirement, he gestures around the busy lab. The place hums and buzzes with the sounds of grinding and polishing. “I am having too much fun to quit.” <br><br>On his break-room table are boxes of assorted chocolates and gourmet cookies, various sweets, all with thank you cards from grateful clients and dentists. “Help yourself,” he tells a visitor, “more work for me.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/pulling-his-own-tooth-with-a-pair-of-pliers-started-a-career-jim-crow-south-dental/

It was the day of their wedding anniversary, and they were waiting for the bus to go to the zoo. <br><br>The driver, Mary Fong Lau, 78, was driving the wrong way down Ulloa Street. She was arrested the following day, and police are still investigating the incident.

He promised that, as supervisor, he would work with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to identify all danger zones in District 7 and “take precautions to make sure we avoid tragedies like this,” though, in 100 words, he did not specify exactly how. <br><br>The city has failed in its Vision Zero goal: Fatal collisions have increased since 2014, and 2022 saw the most traffic deaths in San Francisco since 2007.<br><br>For Martin-Pinto, it is “important to let the facts come out in this case” before proposing solutions, though he did suggest changing the configuration of bus stops and enforcing traffic regulations. Likewise, the two other candidates noted that lack of traffic enforcement is an issue. <br><br>Traffic enforcement has collapsed across San Francisco since 2014, particularly in the aftermath of the pandemic. Police officers are issuing a small fraction of the citations they did 10 years ago, leading supervisors to hold pointed inquiries into the problem last year. <br><br>Melgar, for her part, pointed to both enforcement and slowing down cars, alongside physical protective infrastructure like bollards. She also went further by suggesting that certain areas around public transportation hubs should be fully pedestrianized and closed to cars altogether. <br><br>Their answers are below, but I also wanted to let you know that I will be in your district on Monday, March 25 at 1 p.m. at Ballast Coffee (329 West Portal Ave.).

Around it, a flow of pedestrians and bicycles stream through the intersection, hardly noticing the felled former silk oak.<br><br>But the stump is new; it’s the remnant of a silk oak — which, despite its name, is not an oak at all but part of a completely different family of trees — that city crews cut down on March 16. Its exact age and height were not recorded by the city, but it was at least 30 years old and 50 feet tall, according to an estimate by Allegra Mautner, a Public Works urban forestry inspector who has kept an eye on the tree. <br><br>“It was kind of sad,” said Cassandra, who works at the nearby Fellow Barber. “It was just here one day, and then it was gone the next.”<br><br>The tree’s death sentence was issued only after multiple discussions, “because it’s such a high-profile tree, and it’s so important to a lot of members of the community,” said Mautner. Earlier, she discussed the issue with multiple supervisors at San Francisco Public Works before defining the tree a hazard that needed to be removed. <br><br>“It’s a very respectful tree,” said Mautner, who’s now going through a process of coming to terms with the decision. “Every time I biked past that tree after I made that decision, I always felt like, ‘Am I making the right decision?’”<br><br>The coup de grâce for the silk oak came in February during a series of windstorms. It dropped several large limbs, and that was that. <br><br>In addition, the tree’s excessive size had rendered its surrounding sidewalk a tripping hazard, impassable for people with disabilities. This constricted foot traffic and activities at a busy intersection, according to Mautner, one of San Francisco’s five urban forestry inspectors who collectively oversee the city’s roughly 125,000 street trees.<br><br>“This tree is very close to me,” she said. She has lived about a block from the silk oak since 2012, and she bikes past it every day on her commute. She took a longer look at the tree during the pandemic, when she did a lot of walking. She noticed the tree because it was a species she had never seen before. <br><br>But that was also one of the factors necessitating its removal. “It had very poor structure, which is common for this species,” Mautner said. Plus, because of frequent failures of small limbs, the tree’s crown had grown much smaller over the past several years. Its roots also topped the sidewalk, and became more unstable after the recent storms washed out some of the soil underneath. <br><br>“We really do try to maintain large trees in the urban environment, because they add so many benefits. but we also have to balance the risk that they pose to the public,” Mautner said. Throughout the years, the urban forestry team had added some asphalt patches to temporarily fix the area around the oak. These had degraded over time. City officials also considered a longer term-fix of doing more sidewalk work, but that was deemed infeasible because of the tree’s massive root structure.<br><br>Its size also prevented it from being transplanted. And even if moving the tree were an option, its deteriorating health made the odds of it surviving a transplant low.<br><br>Mautner conducted a final assessment in February, and deemed the silk oak a hazard. “I’m such a tree hugger. Then I have people who tell me that I’m such a tree hater, and I want to remove all the trees in San Francisco,” said the 34-year-old University of California, Berkeley, forestry major. <br><br>Between Feb. 12 to 27, tree removal notifications were posted on its trunk, on the street light posts around it, and on the Public Works website. With an annual tree mortality rate of four percent in San Francisco, Mautner posts new removal notices almost every week to let the community know in advance that a tree is leaving. <br><br>No one protested. <br><br>Mautner took some selfies with the silk oak when she knew it would soon be gone. On March 15, an arborist removed the tree. Soon, the whole site will be paved over. <br><br>A few days ago, Mautner passed an indigenous ceremony in front of City College’s Mission campus on her way home. She knew it wasn’t related. But it struck a chord with her. <br><br>She took comfort in knowing that “the tree had seen so many activities like this, so many marches came by and it lived a good, long life. We were able to keep this tree for a long period of time.”",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/the-50-foot-oak-that-towered-over-valencia-and-18th-for-at-least-30-years-is-now-a-stump/
136fec25-1e8d-4196-92aa-88f32790571c,news,mission,COMMUNITY,BETH WINEGARNER,"MARCH 22, 2024, 6:00 AM",Mission Dolores curator aims to humanize site’s indigenous dead,,"For more than 30 years, Mission Dolores curator Andrew Galvan has been on a quest: To memorialize more than 5,000 indigenous people buried in the mission’s cemetery, some of whom are Galvan’s own ancestors. <br><br>Galvan, a former archaeological consultant, remembers visiting Monsignor John O’Connor at Mission Dolores, the basilica’s pastor from 1983 to 1999, in the early 1990s, when the historic site was getting ready for a post-Loma Prieta seismic retrofit.<br><br>“We were having afternoon tea. He brought out the burial register and baptismal records, and we found my ancestors,” he said. <br><br>Galvan’s ancestor, Liberato Culpecse, was baptized in 1801 at Mission Dolores, but later moved to Mission San Jose. Culpecse’s parents, Jobocme and Poylemja, are buried in the mission’s cemetery, along with 5,700 other indigenous people, in unmarked graves. After seeing their names in these 200-year-old books, Galvan started thinking about ways to make all those ancestors more visible. <br><br>“I’ve collected the names of the Indians who were here during the Mission period,” Galvan said one afternoon in January, sitting in the pews of the old mission church. “Originally, I thought I could add an adobe wall and create plaques with all of the names. But even in 1992, it would have cost $1 million.”<br><br>Today, Galvan hopes to build a new, bigger museum on the Mission Dolores property that would include space for a plaque bearing the 5,700 names. The mission already has a small, one-room museum, but this one would extend into the adjacent playground for Mission Dolores Academy — which is part of the mission property, and was built over part of the mission’s cemetery. But the price tag has gone up: Galvan estimates the museum would cost $3 million to $4 million to build, and has only received donations covering a fraction of that amount. <br><br>As he pursues his quest, Galvan said he’ll need to reach out to local tribal groups to get their input. <br><br>“It would be a wonderful way for us to bring it into conversation, their actual names,” said Corinna Gould, co-founder of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust in Oakland, the only local tribal group to respond to Mission Local’s requests for comment. “Giving them names helps to humanize them, which has been difficult for a long time in the Bay Area.”<br><br>Indigenous people have lived on the San Francisco peninsula for more than 13,000 years. In San Francisco, the Ramaytush Ohlone lived in several villages, including one near the present-day mission site, called Chutchui, on the banks of a waterway they named Ehwate. When Franciscan monks, under the guidance of Junipero Serra, arrived in 1776, they decided that Chutchui was the perfect site to build a mission. <br><br>The Franciscans forced indigenous residents into labor. The mission church and other structures, including barns and barracks, were constructed by indigenous hands; not just Ohlone, but also Pomo, Miwok, Patwin and Wappo people from the wider Bay Area. <br><br>Missionaries baptized the indigenous people who lived and worked at the mission, stripping them of their given names and rebranding them with Spanish ones. The hard work, near-starvation rations and waves of infectious illness killed thousands of indigenous people at the site. Galvan wants their names — their indigenous names — to be known again. <br><br>Facing the steep cost of creating a memorial in the ‘90s, Mission leaders put Galvan’s memorial plaque idea on the back burner. O’Connor moved to another post in 1997, and it wasn’t until Galvan was hired as the mission’s curator in 2004 that he picked up the idea again. He wrote a number of proposals and grant requests, including one to the California Missions Foundation for what he called an “Indian memorial” at Mission Dolores. <br><br>“The response I got from the committee was, “What about the names of the Spanish and Irish people buried there?’” Galvan recalled. “I said, ‘It says Indian memorial.’” The grant wasn’t approved. <br><br>In 2009, the mission hired Galvan’s cousin, Vincent Medina (who’s now co-founder of Cafe Ohlone in Berkeley) as assistant curator, and the cousins took matters into their own hands. They bought a pair of redwood boards from Home Depot and carved the names of Jobocme and Poylemja — who are Medina’s ancestors, too — into the wood. They now stand in the mission cemetery. <br><br>“The grave marker in the center of the cemetery is a tangible piece that visitors, community members, and family members can visit that gives proof to specific Native people buried at Mission Dolores. It gives recognition to two of the individuals that are interred there, and even without much label copy tells a story that is necessary to tell,” Galvan and Medina wrote in an academic article published in 2018. <br><br>In that article, they proposed projecting the indigenous dead’s names onto a wall at Mission Dolores. That, too, proved difficult and expensive: None of the mission’s current spaces are quite dark enough, and the projector would burn through about $150 a month in lightbulbs. <br><br>In any case, “I want something permanent, and having it adjacent to the graves makes the most sense,” Galvan said. In 2022, he assisted in creating a similar monument at the Franciscan mission in Sonoma, which reads, “In this sacred grounds lie buried men, women and children of the local Coast Miwok, Patwin, Wappo and Pomo tribes. They built, labored and died at Mission San Francisco Solano.” The site includes a stone etched with the names of 896 indigenous people buried there. <br><br>Burying people in the ground and marking them with individual stones isn’t the traditional way local indigenous people honor their ancestors, though many do it that way today, said Gould, the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust co-founder. Historically, most buried their dead in large shellmounds that were built up with seashells, earth and other materials, and located them within their villages, so the living wouldn’t be separated from them, she said.<br><br>Sogorea Te’ works in the East Bay to reclaim local land and steward it in indigenous ways. Recently, the nonprofit opened ‘Ookwe Park through an adopt-a-park program in Richmond, where tribes will grow and harvest medicinal plants, including yerba buena, mugwort, wild strawberries and soaproot. The site once held a shellmound, which was destroyed in the construction of the Officer Bradley Moody Memorial Underpass, Gould said.<br><br>It also purchased the embattled West Berkeley Shellmound site in March, formerly the location of a village and massive shellmound that covered many city blocks, all the way to the waterfront. The group plans to unearth Strawberry Creek, currently streaming underground, and build a new, poppy-covered shellmound that visitors can climb. <br><br>“We can show the magnitude of what a shellmound was. People can stand up high and see, similar to what my ancestors would have seen,” Gould said.

628f0cea-04a8-4372-9950-ba1f362a292c,news,mission,TROUBLE,JOE ESKENAZI,"MARCH 21, 2024, 12:30 PM",Former SF HR manager charged with looting $627K in workers’ comp,,"In January, San Francisco Human Resources manager Stanley John Ellicott was arrested and charged with a bevy of crimes, including purportedly selling electronics on the internet that had been bought with city money earmarked for earthquake supplies. <br><br>This morning, he was arrested again and hit with more than five dozen charges — most notably, allegedly ripping off some $627,000 from the Workers’ Compensation bureau he oversaw. San Francisco jail records reveal that Ellicott, 38, was booked at 9:07 this morning and is being held on $50,000 bail for his 62 felony charges.<br><br>He is accused of establishing a bogus company and using it to loot the very branch of the HR department that he was charged with keeping both technically and monetarily sound. <br><br>“The charges announced today reflect my office’s continuing commitment to uncover official misconduct in San Francisco’s City government,” District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement.  “My office would like to thank the Department of Human Resources for its swift and thorough cooperation in uncovering the depths of their trusted manager’s great betrayal.” <br><br>The January and March cases against Ellicott are unrelated, but it was the investigation into the former that led to today’s arrest and charging. In addition to allegedly selling high-end consumer electronics bought with emergency supply money, Ellicott was charged in January with participating in a larger municipal theft and kickback scheme operated by former Community Challenge Grant director Lanita Henriquez and former Gavin Newsom mayoral staffer, businessman and city fixer Dwayne Jones. <br><br>The District Attorney alleges that Jones’ company, RDJ Enterprises, paid Ellicott — a city employee at that time — nearly $270,000 over the course of four years. Ellicott then purportedly used Venmo and PayPal to funnel some $65,650 of Jones’ money to Henriquez. <br><br>In an affidavit released today, DA investigator Mike Reilly reveals that scrutiny of Ellicott’s financial transactions regarding the earlier case unearthed a “long series of unusual deposits” into his personal bank account totaling more than $450,000. These payments emanated from a source the DA refers to only as “Witness 1,” a Chicagoan. <br><br>Reilly reached “Witness 1,” who told him her old college pal Ellicott paid her $1,000 in 2019 to establish a company called IAG Services, and to set up a bank account for IAG services using her own name and information. She said Ellicott then took over the account. <br><br>Department of Human Resources managers confirmed to Reilly that Ellicott himself added IAG Services as a vendor into the city system in May 2019. Starting that month and continuing until January 2024 — the month of his prior arrest — more than $627,000 in payments were made from the city to IAG. These “appeared to be fraudulent payments related to otherwise legitimate workers’ compensation benefits.”<br><br>While these payments were ostensibly for “auditing services,” human resources managers told Reilly that no paperwork exists to indicate that any auditing services were actually performed. Ellicott’s former colleagues were unable to locate invoices for most of the payments to IAG, and those they did locate were all approved by Ellicott himself. <br><br>All told, the human resources department provided the DA with 643 workers’ comp claims billed to IAG. Most were billed just once, with a payment between $925 and $986. Between 2019 and January 2024, the total amount paid was $627,118.86. Email records indicate Ellicott either approved these payments himself, or asked colleagues to process them. <br><br>The DA investigator traced more than $450,400 in payments from IAG to Ellicott’s personal bank account over the course of four years. These semi-monthly payments were denoted “Direct Deposit [Witness 1] D BILL PMT BILL PMT.” It was this series of regular payments that first caught investigator Reilly’s eye.<br><br>Following Henriquez’s arrest in August 2023, these payments were purportedly redirected to a different account tied to Ellicott. All told, the DA claims more than $488,000 was transferred between IAG and multiple Ellicott accounts. <br><br>Ellicott began working for the city in 2012, with a brief hiatus between 2015 and 2016. He was a manager at the human resources department from 2017 until January 25 of this year, when he was placed on paid leave.<br><br>Transparent California lists Ellicott’s 2022 pay as $187,884, with benefits of $55,613, for a total compensation package of $243,496. His most recent position with the human resources department was “assistant director of finance and technology.” The human resources department describes his position as being “responsible for the financial integrity of the Workers’ Compensation Division” — the division he oversaw and allegedly looted.<br><br>The Department of Human Resources announced today that it has implemented new controls to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.<br><br>Ellicott’s 62 charges include grand theft, misappropriation of public money, insurance fraud and money laundering. He was arrested “without incident” this morning at his Oakland home, and will face arraignment tomorrow.",https://missionlocal.org/2024/03/stanley-ellicott-workers-comp/

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/
d612525b-a753-466e-bfe4-036d4cffa209,news,richmond,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!<br><br>I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.<br><br>You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.<br><br>Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.<br><br>Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.<br><br>Vince Yuen

Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers. The theater is one of San Francisco’s last remaining historic Neighborhood Movie Palaces, which were known for their bright lights and elaborate character. Its marquee, blade sign, and other character defining features represent the beautiful history of San Francisco. ",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/07/press-release-alexandria-theater-housing-development-reaches-milestone/
baee3633-90fa-413f-8ddf-90aac8b5f8bd,news,richmond,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/

When COVID-19 hit a few of years ago, we lost advertisers. After so many years of relying on ad revenue to create and distribute our community’s newspapers, the time has come to supplement the diminished ad revenue with donations from our readers. We could use our community’s help.<br><br>COVID not only caused many of our advertisers to stop their support, it also has made it difficult for small businesses to spend precious funds on advertising. We are hoping our loyal readers will be able to contribute a little to keep our neighborhood newspapers and website healthy.

Your contribution will connect you to that mission – you can directly help your neighbors.<br><br>• California has lost a quarter of its newspapers and half its newsroom staff in the last 15 years. San Francisco has lost more than half of its neighborhood newspapers over the last decade or so. Your contribution will help the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon to publish for many years to come.<br><br>• Printing and delivery costs are going up. Equipment and supply costs are going up.

The extra pages allow us to tell more stories, publish bigger photos, add new features (cartoons, crossword puzzles, the Announcements section, using current photos alongside the historical photos – “Then and Now”) and more. Ad revenue alone can’t support 16-page papers. Your contribution will help us keep publishing the robust 16-page, and sometimes 20-page, papers.<br><br>We frequently receive compliments on our papers and are often told how much readers love reading the Richmond Review and Sunset Beacon.

While your one vote matters and the political process is important, there’s so much more we can do as San Franciscans to make our city/community even better. Many of our volunteers aren’t’ even old enough to vote, but they’re demonstrating how anyone can make a difference. It’s absolutely amazing what we’ve already accomplished with over 2,200 cleanups organized, 550,000 gallons of trash removed, and 11,000 unique volunteers who have joined a cleanup; but we want even more!<br><br>I’ll be hosting another virtual presentation of “SF Trash Talk” on Tuesday, March 19 from 7-7:45 p.m. The presentation lasts about 20-minutes followed by Q&A. We discuss why SF is so dirty (and it legit is), why it matters, possible solutions, and what we as individuals can to do about it. Spoiler alert: cleanups, because they work. Fill out this Google Form to receive the Zoom link and meeting invite.<br><br>You’re all invited to my Trashy Birthday Cleanup on Saturday, March 23 from 1-3 p.m. in the Richmond neighborhood. I got the inspiration from another volunteer who organized one and this will be the third year I’ve hosted a birthday cleanup. I hope you can make it and celebrate a clean neighborhood with me.<br><br>Lastly, I’d like to put the call out again for empty canned good cans that we repurpose into Butt-Cans and place out as ashtrays for smokers. We’re working hard behind the scenes on legislation to ban filtered cigarette sales in CA, but these things take time and are difficult to accomplish against a very entrenched and resourced tobacco industry. So, in the meantime, we’ll take a more passive approach by encouraging people to properly dispose of their butts in our conveniently placed butt-cans. Please rinse and save any cans you use, then email me when you have a good amount and we can coordinate the handoff.<br><br>Thank you all for protecting our environment and supporting our community. The vision of a cleaner San Francisco comes more into focus with each cleanup. Just keep showing up.<br><br>Vince Yuen

07ec93e8-1542-4330-95fc-403d20b534c2,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Press Release: Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Milestone,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Alexandria Theater Housing Development Reaches Another Milestone<br><br>The City and Alexandria Theater Developer Sign Initial Agreement<br><br>Today, Supervisor Connie Chan announced the initial agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), was signed jointly by TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC and the Office of Workforce and Economic Development. Supervisor Chan has long been advocating for the site, located at 5400 Geary Blvd. in the Richmond District, to be developed into housing while preserving the history of the theater. Now with the signed MOU, the City and the developer can continue to work on details to develop the site.  <br><br>“The Richmond deserves more housing while having a piece of its history persevered,” said Supervisor Connie Chan, who has represented the Richmond since 2021. “We still have more work ahead of us to get to the finish line, and I am committed to continue supporting this process until we get this done.”<br><br>Since Supervisor Chan took office in 2021, she and her team have been working with Mr. Yorke Lee and TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC, historic preservationists, and city staff about options to develop and improve the site. In October 2021, Supervisor Chan worked with Assemblymember Phil Ting and the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development to submit an offer to the owner to purchase the site and develop housing, however the offer was ultimately rejected. After a storm damaged the Alexandria’s blade sign in January 2023, Supervisor Chan began negotiating a Development Agreement with the owner to help create a plan to preserve historic elements of the theater and housing for the site. <br><br>“We are excited about this first step of formalizing our partnership with the City to develop Alexandria Theater into housing, and we are dedicated to ongoing efforts to preserve the Theater’s history and character for the Richmond’s benefit,” said Yorke Lee, Owner of TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC.  “We thank Supervisor Chan for her continuing support, and we share her vision to complete this development as soon as possible.”<br><br>The Development Agreement will be drafted by the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office and facilitated by the San Francisco Planning Department. TimeSpace Alexandria, LLC has already created a design concept for housing that would preserve historic features of the theater and build 76 units, including on-site affordable housing. <br><br>The original 2,000-seat interior of the Alexandria Theatre was converted to a three-screen multi-plex in 1976 and continued to run new releases until it was shuttered in 2004. Over the past two decades, there have been multiple efforts to develop the space, most recently a plan to turn the theater into a multi-use building including a community pool. This was approved by the San Francisco Planning Department, but due to the pandemic, this plan did not materialize. <br><br>The Alexandria Theatre was built in 1923 in the Egyptian Revival architectural style and designed by one of San Francisco’s leading architectural firms, Reid Brothers.

These proposed height increases are concentrated in neighborhood commercial corridors. There are 167 official legacy business in the affected area.<br><br>The plan appears to be a contemporary version of redevelopment programs. It envisions massive demolitions, without regard to what is being lost in the process. There is no consideration of the loss of a sense of community and an understanding that we are not isolated individuals but part of something larger. <br><br>The proponents have failed to learn from the history of redevelopment programs in San Francisco, particularly in the Western Addition and Fillmore. Thousands of people lost their homes and businesses. A vibrant African American culture was lost and has never recovered. Efforts to bring back what was lost have all failed.<br><br>The negative impacts of this upzoning will be felt long before the first new unit is constructed. The adoption of the plan will immediately result in increases in land values. Landlords will be motivated to rid their property of tenants to maximize that value. Renewals of expired commercial leases will likely be threatened, impacting the survival of small and neighborhood businesses. Landlords in residential buildings will have an incentive to keep their buildings unoccupied. <br><br>The Planning Department acknowledges that it has yet to develop plans to protect displaced local and neighborhood businesses. The planners assume that such businesses will be able to relocate to the new buildings. There has been no analysis of the feasibility of such relocations, especially after the passage of years before the new buildings are constructed. How would such businesses survive until they are relocated and how could they be protected from huge rent increases? The history of the Western Addition and South-of-Market redevelopment areas has a clear message: The small businesses do not survive.<br><br>There appears to be no real plan to protect vulnerable residential tenants from displacement. The Planning Department acknowledges that current ideas are inadequate and more extensive measures need to be developed. Developing these measures will be of little value after the fact.<br><br>This proposal anticipates a substantial increase in population. The Planning Department acknowledges that there is no current analysis or plan to deal with the provision of needed infrastructure for the increased population. There has been no study of the financial feasibility of providing these services, everything from sewer and electrical capacity to the need for parks and open space.<br><br>What will be the impact on schools, local businesses as well as the availability of grocery stores, childcare facilities, and playgrounds? The plan is designed to be transit intensive and the new buildings will have little or no parking. Yet, there has been no consideration of either the practicality of or financial feasibility of making the required improvements to the transportation system. <br><br>The assumption of a dramatic increase in population is not supported by recent data. Since the 2020 census, the population of San Francisco has fallen, not increased. The 2020 census found 873,965 residents; the census bureau’s estimate as of July 1, 2022 is 808,427, a decline of 7.5%. Is there any solid reason to project a significant population increase?<br><br>Though the City’s population increased by 38% since 1940, the number of housing units increased by 79% – and yet, in the early 2020s, the City was experiencing a housing shortage, understandable only because the average housing unit in 1940 held three people, and the average housing unit in 2020 held two.<br><br>Although the proposed upzoning is couched in terms of creating housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households, families, seniors, people with disabilities, essential workers, by far the most extensive impact would be to create large amounts of market-rate housing, and there is limited evidence to justify such an expansion of market-rate housing.<br><br>The state mandated 2023-2030 Regional Housing Needs Assessment Needs Allocation requires San Francisco to approve more than 82,000 units over a period of seven years. Of these, 35,400 units are “affordable housing” units ranging from those affordable to extremely low-income households to those affordable to moderate income households. The cost of building such affordable housing over the next seven years is about $19 billion. <br><br>The bond measure on the March ballot in the amount of $300 million is only 1.5% of that. <br><br>The only solution that this upzoning offers is based on the neoliberal theory that markets will solve our problems. This has never worked and won’t work this time.<br><br> The massive rezoning is a blunt instrument applied throughout large swaths of the City without an examination of the differences between neighborhoods and how the impacts would vary from area to area. For example, there are numerous areas with substantial historic resources included in the rezoned areas, yet there are only vague and unconvincing answers as to how those areas can be protected. This issue is being left for future analysis.<br><br>San Francisco has about two years before it is required to respond to state demands. A thorough economic analysis of potential impacts should be conducted before any upzoning is adopted. The City should take advantage of that time to develop a carefully crafted program that recognizes our most important values, including the value of community. <br><br>Dennis Antenore is a former member of the SF Planning Commission.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/18/commentary-mayors-upzoning-plans-will-damage-sfs-neighborhoods/

If I had the opportunity to lead in our neighborhood in any official capacity, I’d focus our civic resources on what matters most to neighbors – crime, safety, small businesses, housing, and homelessness – all while shaking up and exposing the layers of bureaucratic nonsense and lack of accountability that have infected SF City Hall. But alas, I don’t have the experience, network or the chutzpah needed to move the needle in City Hall in these directions. Marjan, however, does, and she will. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.<br><br>Her political detractors who whine and cry, “What has she done for the neighborhood?” Or, “Where has she been since 2020?” simply haven’t been paying attention or are too busy playing global and identity politics in their own political bubbles. All while Marjan has been expressly focused on making her neighbors’ lives better these past four years. To give just a small sample:   <br><br>… take a wild guess. Hint: It’s not our supervisor, her predecessor or any of the tiny cabal of sanctimonious, out-of-touch, stuck-in-the-’60s, extremist activists who scowl disapprovingly at any real progress or action, only coming out of their insular caves when election season is upon us. (Aside: It boggles my mind how many neighbors tell me that they get no response when they call or email Chan’s office. Isn’t responding to constituents simply table stakes for holding elected office?)   <br><br>Thankfully, the political winds are changing as is evidenced by the complete and utter rejection of incumbents like Chan and her positions in the most recent elections (Chan was against the DA recall, against the school board recall, pro-Cop Tax, and ran on pro-defund the police). Every time, she supported the opposite point of view as the majority of the electorate. The results of these recent elections clearly show that residents are choosing to believe their eyes more than the shaky voices of local elected officials, like Chan, who deliver word-salad speeches out of both sides of their mouths while real problems only get worse. <br><br>If you want to stick with the civic decay ravaging our City, then, by all means, support Connie Chan and her noisy virtue-signaling allies to continue their reign of ineptitude. But if you think we need to course-correct with policies and attitudes that consider common sense, a dose of tough love, and the belief that local government should deliver results, then email Marjan. (Marjan@votemarjan.com)  She’ll respond to you. <br><br>Huh. Imagine that.<br><br>Mark Dietrich is a local Richmond District neighborhood organizer and vocal public safety advocate.

To this day, artificial turf and rubberized surfaces are being installed in playing fields and playgrounds. Micro-plastic pollution is a threat to all life on the planet.

c06f6bd1-b36d-4e3a-b3dd-40cc1edb59dd,news,sunset,COOKING TOGETHER,,"MARCH 12, 2024",‘Cooking Together’: Wild Rice Pilaf,,"Wild Rice Pilaf<br><br>By Shanta Nimbark Sacharoff<br><br>I love wild rice! When I cook wild rice, it smells very earthy. I associate wild rice with harvest holidays and make it during that time. However, this extremely healthy grain is available year-around. So, why not cook and eat wild rice more often? Listed here are some health benefits of wild rice and a recipe.  <br><br>Wild rice is not a variety of rice, although it is related to the rice grain. Wild rice is an aquatic grass with an edible grain that has been used as a staple for hundreds of years by Native Americans. They harvested wild rice by canoeing into a stand of plants, and bending the ripe grain heads with two small wooden poles, and then threshing the seeds into the boat. While much of the wild rice harvested in California uses modern industrialized methods, the old traditional way of harvesting wild rice is still practiced by Native people. <br><br>In addition to having a great history as an old staple, wild rice has many health benefits. Wild rice is 100% gluten-free, so it is suitable for a gluten-free diet. Wild rice contains more protein and fewer calories than most whole grains. It is a good source of protein, iron and calcium and a great source of dietary fibers which are important in regulating our digestion and blood pressure. Wild rice also provides many important micronutrients such as folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, zinc, Vitamin B6 and niacin. Research indicates that wild rice contains antioxidants which protect us from free radicals that can damage our cells. <br><br>Wild rice is expensive as it is difficult to grow and harvest. But its unique nutty texture, earthy flavor and its nutritional profile makes it worth the cost. Some food distributors mix wild rice with other rice to make the package more affordable. I don’t like this option because wild rice takes longer to cook than regular rice as the former has a thick hull. I recommend that you keep and make wild rice and other rice separately and mix them together after cooking as in the recipe presented here. <br><br>1 cup basmati rice, washed and drained completely <br><br>2 cups of water<br><br>½ cup wild rice, washed and drained well <br><br>1½ cups water <br><br>½ teaspoon salt (optional)<br><br>2 teaspoons oil, any type<br><br>¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or walnut pieces<br><br>¼ cup goji berries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>or <br><br>¼ cup dried cranberries, soaked in 1 cup of hot water for ½ hour then drained<br><br>First cook the basmati rice and wild rice separately. Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepot with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the basmati rice and bring to a boil again.  Then turn the heat down and cover the pot with a lid, keeping it slightly ajar. Cook for five minutes and then cover the lid completely.  Cook for additional 5 minutes.  Keep the pot covered for several minutes. Then open the pot and fluff the rice with a fork and set it aside.<br><br>In a second saucepot, boil 1½ cups of water with ¼ teaspoon salt (optional) and a teaspoon of oil. Add the drained wild rice and allow the mixture to come to a boil. <br><br>Then lower the heat and cover the pot. Cook for ½ hour. Check to see if it needs more water, adding a few tablespoons if the mixture is too dry. Cover and cook for an additional 15 minutes or a bit longer, until the wild rice grains are opened and they are giving a nutty aroma. Keep the lid closed for a few minutes when the wild rice is done.<br><br>Next, mix the cooked basmati rice with the wild rice. Add the goji berries (or cranberries) and the toasted pumpkin seeds or walnuts. Mix again and serve the dish hot. Alternatively arrange the two grains, the berries and the seeds (or nuts) in a platter as illustrated. Serve this dish to accompany a bowl of soup or a vegetarian entrée with a sauce. <br><br>Makes six servings.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/12/cooking-together-wild-rice-pilaf/
91638f70-c9b6-4cbb-90e1-3656cc057621,news,sunset,PRESS RELEASE,,"MARCH 8, 2024",Press Release: Outside Lands Community Benefit Fund Recipients Announced,,"From District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan:<br><br>Supervisor Connie Chan Announces Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund<br><br>On March 7, Supervisor Connie Chan was joined by Community Benefit Fund recipients and Another Planet Entertainment to announce $110,000 in funding for community based organizations and programming from the Golden Gate Park Community Benefit Fund. <br><br>“Thanks to the advocacy work and feedback of District 1 residents, we have now identified ways to utilize the Golden Gate Park Concert Community Benefit Fund to truly support our neighborhood needs. Not only have we worked to create benefits for the Richmond, but we also are bringing free concerts to downtown,” said Supervisor Connie Chan. “This is the true spirit of the Richmond, we look out for each other and we look out for the City. That’s why we are, indeed, the coolest neighborhood in the City. ”<br><br>As part of the contract with the City to close parts of Golden Gate Park for the Outside Lands (OSL) Festival each year in August, Another Planet Entertainment (APE) provides $25,000 to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods including the Richmond District and the Outer Sunset, to mitigate the impacts the concert series has on the districts, including park closure. Last year, the City agreed to expand the concert series to include a smaller scale concert the weekend after the OSL Festival. Supervisor Chan negotiated an additional $10,000 each for the Richmond and Outer Sunset to be added to the Community Benefit Fund for this new weekend closure, in addition to free concerts downtown, in order to generate positive activity and revenue for the rest of the City. <br><br>Supervisor Chan also asked that APE hold community meetings with the Recreation and Park Department to allow additional public input into the concert expansion. The Outside Lands concert series brings many benefits to the City as a whole, including union jobs and economic benefits, generating over $1 billion since it first began. However, residents of the Richmond District shared their concerns about the impacts the park closure and concerts have on the neighborhood. They raised issues of the lack of revenue for local small businesses, difficulty with parking, harm caused to native wildlife, and trash left by concertgoers as some of their main concerns. <br><br>“We’re really happy that Outside Lands has such a positive economic impact on San Francisco, in addition to its financial contributions to the City and to the Recreations and Parks Department,” said Allen Scott, president of Concert and Festivals for Another Planet Entertainment and Outside Lands. “We are also proud to invest in the festival’s surrounding neighborhoods and give back to the Richmond and Sunset districts to enhance their communities.” <br><br>After the community meetings, Supervisor Chan created a plan for the Community Benefit Fund to mitigate the impacts experienced by Richmond District residents. The plan includes funding for Richmond District merchants through expanded neighborhood celebrations like night markets and festivals. <br><br>“As a merchant along the Geary corridor, I am very happy to be standing here today with Supervisor Connie Chan. We are grateful for her support in planning a night market and to bring additional foot traffic and revenue to our Richmond District merchant corridors,” said Sean Kim, vice president of the Geary Merchants and Property Owners Association. <br><br>Additionally, Supervisor Chan has identified funding for local Parent-Teacher Organizations (PTOs) to provide parking support for Richmond District residents, funding for local nature conservations programs, funding to beautify the neighborhood and funding for additional recreation equipment for the Richmond Recreation Center. <br><br>“The PTOs help provide critical support for our local elementary schools,” said Lamar Heystek, co-chair of the Argonne Elementary School PTO. “One of our biggest fundraisers is providing neighborhood parking support during the Outside Lands festival weekend. We thank Supervisor Chan and her office for helping us continue providing this service, giving back to the neighborhood while still benefiting the school.” <br><br>“I have been planting dahlias at the Cabrillo Playground for 15 years, I am so thankful to Supervisor Chan for this funding which will help bring more beautiful flowers to the neighborhood,” said Dr. Devi Joseph, founder of Friends of Cabrillo Playground. “Come visit us and see the dahlias for yourself in the Summer and Fall!” <br><br>“San Francisco Nature Education has provided San Francisco children with environmental education and field trips to local parks for over 20 years.” said Nancy DeStefanis, president and Founder of the San Francisco Nature Education. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan’s support we are able to continue this wonderful work and help protect the wildlife in the Richmond District.” <br><br>“Ping pong is a great recreation for Asian elders year round, but the equipment at the Rec Center is aging and makes it difficult for us to play,” said Humphrey Woo, Richmond District resident and ping pong player. “Thanks to Supervisor Chan, we will have much needed new equipment for our community and we will be able to make sure we reserve one table for children who want to learn to play.” <br><br>The Outside Lands Festival will be held on Friday, Aug. 9 – Sunday, Aug. 11 in Golden Gate Park. The Polo Fields concert will occur the following weekend, Saturday, Aug. 17 – Sunday, Aug. 18.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/08/press-release-outside-lands-community-renefit-fund-recipients-announced/
962ccb32-cbd8-46a7-9f8e-d56e4872ad8d,news,sunset,REAL ESTATE,,"MARCH 7, 2024",Real Estate: John M. Lee,,"Spring Market is Upon Us<br><br>2024 is here, and like any other year, people are preparing for the big push in the spring real estate market. However, unlike every year, there is uncertainty and anxiety in the air.<br><br>Last year was a time for reflection and adjusting to the new reality. Mortgage interest rates at 7% felt so high compared to 3% just a couple of years ago. Prices were declining and the market was at the slowest level we have seen for at least the last 25 years. Buyers and sellers were confused as to where prices were, where they are currently, and especially where they will be in the future.<br><br>Sellers holding out for higher prices of years past took their properties off the market. Buyers waiting for interest rates to drop sat on the sidelines. In a market in transition, this is what we normally see.<br><br>However, life must go on. There are property owners who need to sell because their life circumstances changed. There are buyers who are making the decision that, yes, interest rates are higher, but prices are lower. So, they are buying in at the lower price point with opportunities to refinance to a lower rate when it does come down. In retrospect, a 6-7% interest rate is not all that high. We have just been spoiled by the historic 3-4% rates, and that is probably not going to come back in the near future.<br><br>The first two months of 2024 started with a low amount of inventory; we saw some multiple offers and overbidding again. Where it goes is anyone’s guess at the moment. Currently, I am seeing more properties being prepared for the market and expect a decent spring selling season.<br><br>If you are preparing your home for sale during this time, there are many more factors to consider. Have you ever wondered why some homes sell at a higher price than others? The answer lies in pricing and emotional appeal. Purchasing a home is a very emotional process and usually creates a very stressful time in the life of the purchaser. Many times, buyers are making the largest financial commitment of their lives and are unsure of whether they are getting the right deal.<br><br>Thus, when other people are competing on the same property, the multiple offers reassure buyers that they are making the right decision because others feel the same way about the home as they do.<br><br>As a seller then, how do you create these emotions so that your property will sell quickly and for the highest price in today’s market? Preparing a property for sale is key because people today are busier than before, and thus they are looking for homes which are in move-in condition.<br><br>There are many inexpensive preparations which will bring returns many times over for sellers.<br><br>First of all, declutter the house. It’s amazing how much stuff accumulates over the years. By removing large items of furniture and putting belongings away makes a home show larger than it is, and gives the impression that the home is spacious and well cared for.<br><br>Painting and freshening up the backyard can be inexpensive, and yet provide the impression that a home is well maintained. Refinishing the hardwood floors will do wonders for showing off the house.<br><br>If you want to go further, staging companies are available who will bring in complete sets of furniture to complement the age and décor of the house. We have found that this adds tremendous value, makes your home show like a model and separates your home from others on the market. As Richmond and Sunset homes are selling for well above the million-dollar mark now, the staging expense is becoming a smaller percentage of the selling price and thus makes more economic sense than ever before.<br><br>Buying is an emotional process. When a buyer walks into the home, I have a good feeling about whether he or she will buy that house. In order to obtain the highest possible price, buyers need to feel comfortable and know that this is the right home for them.<br><br>Marketing in our modern world is different from the past. Online presence plays a bigger role with most buyers deciding whether to go visit a property or not based on the internet presence. Virtual tours with good photos and videos are more important than ever.<br><br>Buying and selling a home is a stressful and emotional time in one’s life, and even more so during this uncertain time. But no matter what happens, there will be people who need to buy or sell. And that’s when good advice is necessary from a professional in helping to make that buying and selling decision as easy and painless as possible.<br><br>John M.

That’s why I prioritized hiring a dedicated community safety liaison to help Sunset residents and merchants affected by crime.<br><br>Meet Vindy Chan. She’s fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English to serve everyone in the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy is a civilian who will work at Taraval Police Station and my City Hall office. Much of her time will be spent in the Sunset neighborhoods, helping crime victims while using a preventative approach to public safety.<br><br>Residents, small business owners and community organizations in the Sunset can benefit from Vindy’s role. She can help victims fill out police reports and apply to vandalism relief and graffiti abatement programs offered by the City.<br><br>She will also follow up on 311 requests that involve public safety hazards – like fallen tree limbs and broken sidewalks – to make sure they are resolved.<br><br>Vindy will coordinate with city agencies to address tent encampments and other quality of life issues in the Sunset. At Taraval Station, Vindy will provide administrative support for police officers so they can spend more time in the field responding to 911 calls.<br><br>Vindy was born in China and grew up in Hong Kong. She has strong Sunset connections. When she first moved to San Francisco at age 20, her first neighborhood was the Sunset. Her husband is also from the Sunset.<br><br>Vindy attended City College and San Francisco State University, earning a degree in international business.<br><br>Before joining my team, Vindy worked in property management and saw what was happening in San Francisco regarding crime, especially to seniors. As a regular volunteer for Self-Help for the Elderly, she wanted to make a difference.<br><br>“I spent the first half of my career helping corporations,” Vindy said. “I want to spend the second half of my career helping people.”<br><br>Relief for Small Businesses on Taraval<br><br>I worked with the Board of Supervisors’ budget chair, the director of the city’s office of small business and the mayor to secure $1 million in relief funds for small businesses struggling on Taraval due to the Muni track reconstruction.<br><br>The once-in-a-century replacement of Muni’s train tracks and all utilities and infrastructure under Taraval Street has been a major disruption for small businesses. First, the mom-and-pop restaurants and stores on Taraval had to face the pandemic. Now, they have to survive the entire street being ripped up. It’s a huge burden.<br><br>Some businesses reported a huge loss of their sales. It will be a travesty if we have brand new train tracks and boarding islands serving a corridor without any businesses.<br><br>The track replacement will improve the entire corridor. The final result will benefit Taraval and its small businesses for the next 100 years. But we can’t just give up on today’s mom-and-pop merchants. They need to make it through the infrastructure improvements and road construction. We need them to be around when the train comes back.<br><br>That’s why I worked to secure $1 million in relief funds. I asked leadership from SFMTA and the mayor’s office to join me in meeting directly with Taraval merchants to hear their concerns. We met at a struggling restaurant on Taraval and merchants expressed their frustration with the City.<br><br>It was clear that Taraval merchants need financial support. Funds were not set aside years ago when this project was first planned. But money is tight in our current budget deficit.<br><br>We are fortunate to have some unspent funds from last fall’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference of world leaders in San Francisco. During APEC, there were small businesses who were harmed by no fault of their own. The merchants suffered from the decisions and actions of city agencies.<br><br>Taraval merchants have a similar experience. They have faced years of disruptions and are at the mercy of the SFMTA and city agencies to finish this project as promised by the end of this year. I felt we should use some of the unspent APEC funds to help Taraval merchants.<br><br>The $1 million for Taraval was added as an amendment to an ordinance that had only proposed relief funds for SOMA merchants. The budget committee vote for the amendment was unanimous, including Supervisor Myrna Melgar who represents the section of Taraval east of 19th Avenue.<br><br>Many residents have asked about the parking situation on Taraval. Some of the parking lost during construction will return. The parking spots not returning are because of the new boarding stations that are required for accessibility and safety. Train passengers used to have to exit into oncoming traffic and it was dangerous.<br><br>If you want to see what Taraval will look like when the project is finished, tour west of Sunset Boulevard where the first phase of construction is complete. You can see the boarding islands, landscaping and beautification efforts. SFMTA has repeatedly told me that the final phase is on time to bring trains back to the full length of Taraval by the end of this year.<br><br>Residents and merchants can review an online list of updates for work that has been completed and upcoming work that is scheduled each week. Find the updates at sfmta.com/projects/project-updates.<br><br>We are one city. We can help businesses who suffered during APEC last fall and those who continue to suffer today. City Hall must triage the merchant districts and direct resources to the areas in code blue.<br><br>Taraval is in code blue. It’s at risk of dying. We must come together to help a major and vital part of our City. Taraval extends from West Portal to the ocean across two supervisorial districts. Spending a portion of the APEC funds to help Taraval is about saving businesses, which benefits the whole City. Because, if people stop shopping on Taraval and drive to Daly City, that’s less tax revenue for us all.<br><br>This is just the beginning. We need a dedicated relief fund for the future that can offer small businesses a lifeline during major construction projects and disruptive events.<br><br>Joel Engardio is the District 4 representative on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.

47ab6159-4549-417a-8132-2abc9a9905c5,news,sunset,FOOD,,"MARCH 6, 2024",Golden Boy Pizza’s New Location at Old Marco Polo Taraval Site,,"By John Ferrannini<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza, a popular North Beach neighborhood pizzeria known for its square slices of focaccia bread pizza, will be opening a new location at 1447 Taraval St. in the Sunset District.<br><br>The eatery will be coming to the Parkside neighborhood as early as mid-March, according to Julian Sodini, son of founder Peter Sodini.<br><br>The new location is in the former location of Marco Polo Italian Ice Cream, which will be relocating to 3886 Noriega St. in the spring.<br><br>“When my father (Peter) was head of the ship, when I was a kid, he expanded out to five or six locations, but we ended up returning back to the one (in North Beach),” Sodini said. “Now, we’re trying to expand again. Hopefully we can make this time stick.”<br><br>Sodini said he heard that pizza aficionados on San Francisco’s west side were making the trek to North Beach just for slices of the so-called ‘Sanfrancilian-style’ pie (Sicilian-style pizza is typically square).<br><br>“People came downtown just for our pizza,” he said. “So, people now don’t have to make that journey.”<br><br>Despite previous misfires, Sodini said the desire for expansion hasn’t faded.<br><br>“We’ve always been on the hunt. Of course, it has to be the right fit,” he said. “There’s the opportunity at the right time,” he added.<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza does have one other location, in San Mateo, which opened around 2016.<br><br>Sodini said the goal is not to “replace the North Beach location.”<br><br>“The Sunset, the Parkside, the west side of the City has always had a good feeling for us,” Sodini said. “We’re excited to be part of the neighborhood. It’s shaping up to be a renaissance over there.”<br><br>The pizzeria had been considering a new location in downtown San Jose, with hopes it could serve as a late-night food option for the South Bay city’s busy nightlife scene.<br><br>“We were going to open up in San Jose – part ghost kitchen, part take-out window,” Sodini said. “It ended up not working out and, as we were pulling out of that, the Taraval location opened up late last year.”<br><br>The new location will probably not have an inside seating option, at least not initially, though Sodini said he hopes a parklet can be built to accommodate sitting outside.<br><br>The City announced new rules for restaurant parklets last year: Business owners have to pay $2,000 per year for each parking spot a parklet takes away from drivers. More safety measures were also implemented for the program.<br><br>Sodini said that he’s eyeing mimicking the North Beach location’s opening time.<br><br>“I don’t know how late people are out in the Parkside district, but for now, 11-11:30 a.m, and close 8:30-9 p.m. We may push Friday-Saturday a little later, but the general wheelhouse will be 11 a.m.-9 p.m. every day.”<br><br>Sodini said no one is actually “the boss.” Sodini and his siblings manage and run the North Beach location.<br><br>“It’s a family business,” he said. “We’re all partners. I’m the eldest brother, so I have the most tenure. I guess you could say I’m leading the charge, but we all have a hand in it.”<br><br>Golden Boy Pizza first opened in 1978. Its North Beach location at 542 Green St., near several iconic San Francisco watering holes, is a favorite of tourists and locals alike and there are often long lines. The San Mateo location is at 1119 North Amphlett Blvd., by the Coyote Point Recreation Area.<br><br>The pies come in pepperoni, sausage, cheese, combo, vegetable pesto, and clam and garlic, starting at $3.50 a slice.<br><br>Those interested in working at the new Golden Boy Pizza location can send their resumes to taravalsf@goldenboypizza.com. Sodini is hoping to open up in mid-March, but it could be as late as April.<br><br>Learn more about Golden Boy Pizza at goldenboypizza.com/sanfrancisco.php.",https://richmondsunsetnews.com/2024/03/06/golden-boy-pizzas-new-location-at-old-marco-polo-taraval-site/
